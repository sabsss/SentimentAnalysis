"The omatcha black sesame latte is where it's attttt.. I'm gonna go ahead and say that the flavours just go well together since they're both pretty gritty and have that bittersweet taste. The added sugar helps fuse them together and you can definitely tell the distinction between the two. There was only a $0.50 cent difference when it came to the Medium ($5.50) and Large ($6.00), so I just went for the large.

I sampled a couple IPAs while my girl friend had a berry flavored beer from a local microbrewery. She ordered French toast for brunch while I went with the house burger with garlic Parmesan fries. She said the French toast was very good.  My burger was cooked right and was good. The fries were a let down as they seem to use powdered cheese. Our waitress seemed like she had better things to do because about 20 seconds after we sat down she asked what we wanted to order. I hadn't even had time to open the beer list (they have 39 taps). We asked for more time and she seemed annoyed by it. I would go back for the food and he beer but if was sat in her section again I would just go sit at the bar instead.,neutral

"My fiance and I were excited to see a dumpling restaurant open in the area! I'm in love with soup dumplings. And China Mama down the street does a pretty good job of it. It's no 626, but its still good.  They have their own parking lot. Plus!   But first impression is.. the place smells. It's a very pungent bathroom odor. I wouldn't mind if it smelled like cleaning supplies.. but a smelly bathroom/sewage scent is NOT the way to go when you're eating! But it's an asian restaurant. Things like this slip through the cracks all the time. We stayed. We eventually got used to it.  The menu has a lot of items! Most of the English descriptions are pretty vague. So the pictures help a lot. We got lost in all of the choices and took awhile to order.  When we did, we ordered the pan fried beef patties, the soup dumplings, and hot and sour soup.   The patties were good. Crispy, flavorful, and tasted great with a little bit of vinegar and hot sauce.  The hot and sour soup was not as savory as other places I've had, but it was tasty as well. Full of flavor, jusy enough sour.   The soup dumplings normally take longer and were the last to arrive at the table. Tip: normally if you know you're ordering this dish, you should put in the order first. The dumplings were good. As a personal preference, I like my dumplings more sweet than salty, but here they make it salty. Also, there is actually not that much soup in each one.   The menu had other delicious sounding items so we'll probably be back to try other items. But they need to fix that smell!!  Overall.. 626 dumplings beats NY dumplings beats China Mama beats Dumpling King",neutral
"Bottom line, my jeep is clean. All the caked on mud and glory from this weekend's fishing trip washed away. But at what cost? $15 to be exact, and fear. Yes my car is clean, but how could anything not be clean after going through this place?! It's the most aggressive car wash I've ever experienced. No noticeable damage caused to my paint so I guess it's okay. However, DO NOT go in here with a traditional, non-retractable antennae or you will not once, but twice watch in horror as you antennae get's bent nearly horizontal and then disappears into the brush. How it survived it beyond me. All that aside, for the price, I feel like my car is no more clean and polished than those $7 laser washes which also do under carriage cleaning.

Should be more open to the bar area where most of the people are and the action is. The food was decent, but pricey. The regular burgers were good... Great buns! But an up charge for cottage cheese??  I don't mind paying $10 for a burger if it's great and the atmosphere is enjoyable... But Not the case here. The cottage cheese was listed as one of the side options, so makes no sense that there was an extra $1 charge! Our waitress was very nice and attentive, but food delivery was slow (kitchen issue, not a service issue). I think they missed the mark in the way the restaurant was laid out. Not sure I'd go back except to be in the bar area and watch sports. Needs a patio too!",neutral

I'm getting really irritated with this gym. I was doing the 30 minute express workout area in ORDER like you suppose to do.  I was almost finished and the dude plops down on the machine I was supposed to be on and just sits there and texts.

"Loved the clean feel and open space. I came for coffee and some friends got more custom coffees and breakfast food. I found the service to be ok, but they were either understaffed or not communicating well. My iced coffee wasn't made and I had to ask after the sandwiches were made for it to be made. Breakfast sandwich options aren't easily visible/seen on the menu. The sandwiches were all very greasy, too. The center area with gifts and coffee was really cute... a little on the higher end of price for the items, though. The high point is the pastry window. The macaroons are gluten free and got high marks. Might be better with a little work on the service and delivery. Oh, and they're closed Sundays.",neutral

"I believe in giving the good with the bad when it comes to reviews and I hope that this will help others make a more informed decision.  I should probably give some background to other hotels we've stayed at on The Strip so you have a point of reference:  The MGM Grand, New York New York, The Venetian, Caesar's Palace, and The Luxor.  For the record, I would stay at the Flamingo 100 times before I would go back to the Luxor, but that place was awful.  We've also stayed at a couple of the Hilton Grand Vacations on or very near the strip as well.  I'll start with the good.  If you've ever been to the Las Vegas Strip, you know how awesome The Flamingo is located.  Regardless of the accommodations, you have to appreciate how centrally it is located.  Our experience with the hotel staff (as opposed to the dealers) was overwhelmingly positive.  They didn't do anything extraordinary to set themselves apart but they acted in ways that reflected positively on the hotel.  Now the not-so-great.  First, it should be noted that as of May 2018 the Flamingo appears to be going through a big renovation and when you book you can either book one of those newer rooms or one of the older rooms.  I opted for the latter but on reflection I probably made a poor choice.  Would I have had a different experience in one of the renovated rooms?  I'm not sure, but the Studio King we reserved was underwhelming.  The room size was nice, with a large living area set aside from the bedroom (which had no windows, a big plus).  But the room was beyond sad.  The carpet had not been cleaned in a generation or two and the stains were so bad my wife refused to walk on it barefoot.  The light when you walked in didn't work and was not repaired while we were there.  The room had two telephones, one of which did not work when we arrived but was quickly replaced (like in 10 minutes or so -- very quick).  When you looked at the ventilation you saw what appeared to be decades of caked-on dust and debris -- it was disgusting.  And the bathroom was so small that two people could not fit unless one was taking a shower (which dripped constantly and was prone to leaking more when the water was turned on upstairs).  In all fairness the bedroom was so far away that you could not hear it while you were trying to sleep.  However, the bed was so uncomfortable that we got very little sleep.  I know that bed comfortableness is a personal thing; these beds were FIRM.  If that's your jam, you will probably like these beds.  The sound-proofing of the rooms was also not particularly great.  This is another subjective thing but other hotels on the strip do a better job -- and you'll pay more for them as compared to the Flamingo.  The other underwhelming part of our trip was our universal -- and surprising -- negative experience with the dealers we interacted with.  I'm sure there are good one's there, but we didn't interact with any of them.  These people seemed dead on the inside and clearly were considering the bad decisions that led them to have to work in that casino.  By comparison, we also gambled at Harrah's a couple of doors down and had a very different experience overall, and they're both owned by the same company.    Overall our experience with the hotel was ""meh.""  Our friends wanted to stay here and we had a great time with them but there was nothing about our hotel experience, exclusive of the price, that would make me want to come back.  Looking back at this review maybe I should give two-stars but it was far from the worst hotel experience.  And I'm aware that we could have elected for one of the renovated rooms and I find it hard to judge them harshly when I made an informed decision, even if I regret that decision.",neutral

"Zoozacrackers Deli inside the Wynn was the most feasible option for a dinner date before catching Le Reve because we only had 45 minutes to spare and Zoozacrackers is just a stone's throw away from the Wynn theater.   WYNN BURGER ($11): The entire meal is vegan. Literally the exact same menu option is offered at Society Cafe inside Encore for the same price, but with poorer presentation here (plastic cups instead of glass, etc.). This meal is the cheapest option on the menu because it comes with a chocolate milk shake and fries. Everything else on the menu is served a la carte. I asked for lettuce on my burger and they obliged. I happen to like the chocolate shake but my husband begged to differ. Smh. 3/5 PRO TIP: If you're going to order the Wynn burger, walk on over to Society Cafe for a way better experience!  ZOOZA BURGER ($15.49): Expensive for a burger, but my better half gave it his approval. It's pretty gigantic too, so at least you're getting your moneys worth. 4/5 FRIES ($3.99): Taste like Burger King fries (not necessarily a bad thing). 3/5  VIBE: Upscale Denny's minus the servers + counter service for ordering. I was surprised at how slammed this place was on a Sunday night at 9PM. It's connected to the Sportsbook.    SERVICE: It was near impossible to catch one of the servers for a refill. The option to go up to the registers and ask a cashier for a refill is an option but they were so busy tending to the never ending line of customers we didn't want to bother them. The Deli is pretty much self-serve.   Worth a Return Visit? Our grand total came to $37 and some change. I'm not planning on coming back, but if you're in a rush or are trying to keep your dining costs at a minimum while you're at the Wynn, Zoozacrackers Deli will do.

I was pleasantly surprised when we got to the menu.  I ordered:  Shitake Tempura -$6.00 - Sounded great, It was a bit of a letdown it lacked taste and there was little desire to finish the appetizer. Yam/Avocado Roll $5.00 - An interesting twist that isn't at all sushi locations. I saw it and had to try it. Well worth it. Salmon Tempura Rolls $6.00 - Not your standard Salmon Tempura roll but was pleasing. California Roll $6.00 - Standard California Roll, not bad at all. (Note: These prices are approximated)  It could have gone wrong, but it didn't. Definitely worth a look if you are in the Bay/Bloor area.",neutral

"I'm really torn about this place. Their food is a bit tastier than Sichuan Gourmet up the road (which was already pretty good), and they give better portions. For a while it was my go-to place for Sichuanese takeout. However, after a few disastrous take-out experiences I think I'm giving up.  A couple of weeks ago I placed my traditional order of Shredded Pork and Dry-fried Green Beans over the phone. They confirmed the price and time. However, when I picked up my order, they had substituted the Chinese menu shredded pork for the more expensive Americanized version. It was not good at all. However, I ordered by phone and can't really blame them for misunderstanding or ""misunderstanding"" an item with a similar name.  I decided to place orders on their website instead to remove any problems. For two orders this went great. It was ready for pickup on my way home from work, and the food was great. However, my most recent order was a disaster. When I got there to pick it up, the employee at the counter looked at me like I was nuts, insisting that they never got the order. I showed her the email, and she searched her desk. Finally she found the order, never sent to the kitchen, buried under some papers. She offered no apology and just said ""Wait 15 minutes."" Given I had placed the order 45 minutes ago, that wasn't going to happen. I said to cancel the order, and she just nodded and then turned around and started talking to the other employee next to her. That was it, not even a ""sorry."" Mistakes do happen, especially with printed orders. However, their dismissive way of handling it was really unfortunate.  I might go back to eat inside sometime soon because I love their food, but unfortunately given their level of service I don't think I can suggest ordering take-out.",neutral

"Solid 3-star. Could be so much better, but ""A-OK"" for what it is. There are three sections: Asian, Dessert and regular Buffet-style.   Asian section had a small selection of sushi (which I didn't try), various hot items like pot stickers, pork buns, etc., fried and steamed rice, various noodle dishes, typical chinese items like beef w/veggie and Gen'l Chang's chicken. Large section of build-your-own-soup where you select the items you want in your soup and give it to someone (I didn't try this, either) to make the soup for you. A lot of people were getting this, so I'm guessing it's decent. Of the items from this section that I had the pork buns were mostly bun and very little pork .. but the pork that was in there was good. Pan fried dumplings were fine as were samosas.   In the regular buffet section, the prime rib was a bit disappointing. Not enough flavor. The fried chicken looked pretty good, but I didn't go back for it. Mashed potatoes w/gravy were good as was the mac & cheese (although it needed to have richer flavor, IMO). There were a lot of choices, but I wasn't in the mood for most of them, so I passed.   See .. I needed to save room for dessert. The dessert section is in the middle, so as I went to check out the Asian section, I saw what was waiting there and I knew I would not want to miss dessert.   Pineapple upside down cake? Ok. Chocolate fountain with marshmallows, macaroons and fruit for dipping? Certainly! Cotton damn candy .. wrapped? I'll take one to go. thankyouverymuch.  Sure.

"3 stars for friendly service and decent food.   My husband and I went to have dinner there the other night. We figured that this place had to be on point. The line is always wrapped around the building whenever we would go to Albertson's for groceries. So we gave it a shot. Being pregnant, I have had my infamous food aversions, so I no longer have a love for chicken. So I was looking forward to sinking my teeth into a nice, juicy, char grilled burger!   Once we got home, we tasted our food. The French fries were stale and kind of chewy. Probably not their fault. French fries tend to get a little cold and stale once you get home from the establishment. I ordered the Garlic Portobello mushroom burger and my husband ordered the BBQ bacon burger. Well, they were pretty good. But honestly, I can live without ever having to eat there again. The burgers tasted like something you can get from Applebee's or TGIFriday's. Not bad, but nothing original or to run through the neighborhood screaming about. We will just stick to Smash Burger, Bachi Burger and In n Out for now on.",neutral

"Let's hold the phone here for a minute people-- solid sandwich place? Yeah I'm with you.   Best sandwich in Las Vegas? Not even close, bub.  This particular location gets a fair amount of late night traffic. I can't deny that yours truly was out with some friends enjoying the Ghostbar and Moon before stopping by for a sandwich at 3:30. Very cool that they are open so late. I agree with other reviewers-- this is probably your best option in the surrounding food court so go for it if it's there.  I ordered a soup for my friend and got myself an All-American. It seems to be a popular choice, and is a direct competitor of The Bobble, or as it is known by some patrons, the Thanksgiving sub at Capprioti's. You'll taste a hint of sweet cranberry sauce and fair amount of turkey, and a rich creamy ranch. The flavors certainly complement each other  well but it's far from the most memorable sandwich in vegas. The price is pretty reasonable and I think they are a good value. Worth stopping by if you are enjoying a late evening at the Palms, but let's not get carried away with the accolades.",neutral

"I wanted to like this show so badly. The concept was genius: Vegas doesn't want to sit through a 3 hour Broadway musical, so let's just take the best of the hits and put it in an hour and a half show...  First of all. It lasted an hour and ten minutes if that. Second, I love broadway. But these shows are so outdated. And of the outdated-ness there are so many classics missing. They performed these blocks of certain musicals like Cabaret and Chicago instead of moving on to other shows.   They could have really put a decent storyline to this. But they didn't. Instead, they had a few narrators that made you feel really disconnected. Some of the narration was by Steve Wynn that made me feel like I was listening to the discovery channel.   Pretty much every song was your the epitome of a Broadway jazzy show tune. I would have loved to see them slow it down a few times without the cheesy smiles and sequins. Don't Cry for Me Argentina, Memory, I Dreamed a Dream, Music of the Night, Defying Gravity.. These are all ShowStoppers..no?   There were a few moments I was really excited for a song and overall the show was done very well. But when you aren't familiar with a certain musical and they do three songs from it, you get sort of antsy. I hope that they can fine tune this show with audience feedback because I want it to survive.",neutral

"Had my first twin peaks experience last weekend. Here's my review: 1. ""Scenic Views"" - Excellent!  The girls are hot and also personable (at least our waitress was personable).  I joked with my friends that they must recruit at eating disorder clinics as the only chunky girls or girls with any fat or cellulite in the place were customers. The waitresses here stop to chit chat with their customers not just drop off food and drinks and run.    2.  Sports watching: Good.  Lots of TVs ring the bar. we were there to watch Sunday NFL games and all 5 of us have different favorite teams and we were all able to see a TV from our table that had our respective games on them.  Of course you're only getting sound from the big draw game going on but that's everywhere.  3.  Food:  Average/Fair: Nothing memorable, and not a very big selection of food offerings.  The waitresses, who BTW are very good promoters & up-sellers of their food and products, definitely make the limited menu items sound better than they actually were. Not that the food was disappointing or bad, it was just a little over exaggerated/oversold. I and a couple others had hangover burgers which is an average burger with a fried egg on it,  Burgers comes with fries which are the thick steak fry kind and they are seasoned. For the price it would've been nice if it had a couple more topping options were offered with the burger, but how it came out was adequate. My friend had the Philly cheese steak which I had part of.  Now a disclaimer: I'm from Philly originally so rarely do I give a cheese steak outside of the Philly/NJ?NY area a positive review because so often they are missing one or more important parts of what makes a good Philly Cheese Steak.  Twin Peak's version was no exception...I'd call it a decent cheese steak but not a good Philly Cheese Steak.  Another friend had the pork nachos which were good. We had to send something back to the kitchen (not me) due to temperature not being warm enough, but that was quickly rectified    4. Beer: Good! Had their Hefeweizen which was cold and tasty.   Only negative was when the bill for me and my girlfriend's portion came, the waitress had my GF down for 3 big beers instead of the 2 beers she actually ordered. When I brought this to the waitress' attention, she first tried to convince me that she was almost 100% positive my GF had ordered that many beers, however my GF is tiny and she would've been on the floor if she had that many beers in that short amount of time.  Finally the waitress had her manager remove the unordered beer from the bill, but was kind of surprised the waitress argued with us initially.    So I'd go back for the beers, game watching & scenic views.  I'll probably eat elsewhere though before I go.",neutral

"We found this place when Yelping around midnight on a Tuesday night, when we craved some midnight pho, and found out that this is the only pho place that's open past 11pm around the North York area, so we gave it a shot  We ordered take out and the house special pho, as well as their curry brisket beef dish over the phone,  the lady on the phone indicated they would be ready to pickup in 20 min.   When I arrived at the restaurant to pickup around midnight,  I was surprised to see there were quite a few  tables occupied oat midnight on a Tuesday night, I asked the owner and they indicated they open daily until 4am except Mondays!  that's pretty convenient for people living in the area craving pho past midnight~ I guess they are competing for the same clientele as nearby Owl and the rest of the 24 hr Korean restaurants in the area, nice to see there's a bit more variety in the late night dining scene in North York.  The House special pho in take out packages came in separate containers for the soup broth, noodles, as well as the bean sprouts etc, which is great as it maintain the freshness of all ingredients.   They actually provided a clear plastic bowl for the noodles so I guess you could potential just pour the broth into the plastic bowl container with the noodles and ingredients,  which would be very convenient ( we used our own bowls at home instead).  The soup broth is good but not the best we've tried. The curry is a little bit on the oily side but is tasty,  at midnight I wouldn't mind it, but I prob won't come here during regular dinner hours.  Nevertheless, I'm still glad that we have access to latenight pho uptown now, I would recommend this place as a late night snack option~",neutral

"Good service but not the best food in the area.  They advertise as a premium restaurant with great service , warm atmosphere and great food.

This trip I ordered their sirloin with lobster and shrimp butter.  When my entree arrived, cold butter on a warm steak is not a good combination.  I almost ask the server to take it back and re-fire the butter but was worry that they over cook the sirloin.  But as a cut into the steak, it wouldn't have matter, the cut was so bad that my jaw got a good work out tonight .

"I've been waiting for this place to open, since it's so close to the house. I drove by our the other night to see some people in the bar and got excited to know that it was finally open.   My friend and I went there yesterday for some food. Starting with the service, it was good. Our water cups were always filled, and they checked in on us a lot. Although, at some points it was a bit incessant. But, if rather have over the top service than no service at all. Plus, we were the only table there for awhile. Our server, Deena, made things a bit awkward. There was just a lot of awkward silences, and it always seemed like she was whispering, but I can look past that.   As far as the food goes, it felt like there were more appetizers to choose from then there were entrees. Which, probably is a good thing because the appetizers we got were far better than the entrees.   We started with the Portobello fries and the crispy gnocchi. The fries were thick slices of Portobello that were lightly breaded then fried. They.served it with ranch, and some other sauce that I'm falling to remember. The crispy gnocchi had Italian sausage, pesto, peas, and walnuts. While it was good, unless you get a piece of sausage in every bite, the dish lacks a bit of salt.   For entrees, we offered the turkey and cranberry sandwich as well as the jambalaya. I don't know what o was expecting out of the turkey and cranberry sandwich, but I was just expecting more. While the cranberry sauce was good, they added quite a bit, so it overpowered everything else. Their version was a little more spruced up, with spinach and brie cheese. However, the cheese wasn't spread at all, just one slice in the middle. So, I only got one or two really good bites out of the sandwich. As far as the jambalaya, it was decent. Had good flavor, but just needed more. It war very mild tasting. Chicken was conned ti perfection though, so moist ! No sausage in the jambalaya thigh. :(   All in all, would I go back ? Probably. It's the closest place to eat next to my house. I'll probably stick with just ordering more appetizers next time though.",neutral

"Clean, friendly staff and good food.  Giving three stars because I wasn't particularly blown away with the noodle soup broth as it was a little bit oily, and not flavourful like I'm used to. Portion sizes and prices are also smaller, and more expensive compared to your typical mom and pop pho place.  One thing that I really liked about this place was the customizable dishes. So instead of searching through your typical lengthy menu of different soup combinations, their menu actually allows you to choose the types of meats you want.   This is definitely a classier version of a pho place, but with that you lose some of its authenticity.  Good but won't be coming here again unless I'm close by.",neutral

Maybe people don't get out much in Vegas because there are way better places to eat a brunch buffet.  The Buffet at Caesars and The Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan are way better for around the same price.  There were five people in our party and one had a birthday and the total was $210.00 after tax and before tip.  My son said Mom you should gave me the $200.00 and went to eat at Sunrise Cafe.  Wow now I know how rich folks get taken advantage off.  I'll be eating at the other fore-mentioned buffets before I come back here.  One note I will say is that we could have just ordered of the menu and it would have probably been cheaper.  So I cannot review it as a regular restaurant FYI.,neutral

"Tried this place last night. I love the atmosphere, really cozy local pub feel to it. The duck sandwich was pretty good. The staff were not that friendly across the board, no one was rude or unprofessional its more like everyone was just a bit frosty (and not in a cool marine corp way). They only accept cash and debit, which was a bit annoying as I had no cash and did not want to use any of their machines. There was a sign on the door, but I did not see it, so it was my bad for not paying more attention. I plan to pay this place another visit to really make up my mind on it.

"I've tried the Sushi Room twice using a Groupon. Even with the discount, the prices were fairly high for about average sushi.   California Roll - Average taste. They didn't cut the roll evenly, so your first might be a mouthful and your last could be scraps. This is tough when sharing.  Kappa Roll - I am very impressed by this roll. I've never had a cucumber wrapping on sushi, and it tastes delightful and refreshing. It's slippery and falls apart easily when using chop sticks, though.   Caterpillar Roll - It was just Ok. We came with a newbie sushi-eater and I was excited to have her try this one. It didn't impress like it has at other restaurants. They did arrange the roll in a clever ""S"" caterpillar formation.  Vegas Roll - Average.   One friend ordered the red Sangria that I sipped and liked. Light and simple.  The decor of the Sushi Room is cool. They've got some interesting fixtures, a relatively ornate aquarium, and a patio that blends nicely with an open wall. The ""Living Room"" next door is a neat looking lounge with similar architecture. We all remarked that these buildings had a classy, almost European look.  Overall, I would go here if I had a Groupon. With the long distance from my house, quality and price, I will look elsewhere before venturing out again.",neutral

"The guys who work here are really great with their customers. My takeout took 10 minutes longer than estimated, and they gave me egg rolls while they caught up, and then sent me home with more egg rolls.  I LOVE their hand rolls. The fish is perfectly seasoned and I believe they blend tempura bits in giving it a lovely crunch. Their fish to rice ratio is so generous, too. I'm not a big fan of California rolls, but their version as a hand roll is beautiful and eye catching.  I found their rice in the sushi rolls to be a little bit harder than I'd like it, the edges were quite crisp compared to my usual sushi place. Then again, I'm picky and would still order here again.  One flaw, I really disliked the tempura vegetables and shrimp. This is always my go to appetizer and this place really failed it. I don't like their choice of batter as it's a bit thin and hard, and the tempura sauce that comes with it is sweet, which is just... wrong. The vegetables that come with it is a bit odd, like two string beans.  The indoors are beautiful with unique seating, and would be a lovely place to eat in. The tables did smell a little strange however.  I hold this location to the same standards as I would a place in Toronto, so while I did like this place I have too many criticisms to give more than 3 stars. While I won't be ordering the tempura again, I will order a hand roll any day as they've almost perfected it. So good!",neutral

"I tried Rai Lay based on an intriguing article about it in a weekly, Charlotte events publication.  Although I'll give it another try, with friends, I was absolutely not impressed.  However, do not let my review discourage you from trying it out.  Rai Lay calls it's cuisine ""Thai Street Food,"" but from what I can tell, it has more sushi items than actual food you eat on the street in Thailand.  I've been to Thailand a few times, and sushi just isn't something I remember eating off the street.  I also don't remember eating edamame either, although Rai Lay's lunch dishes serve it as a complimentary side (like French Fries, I guess).  That would have been fine, but the edamame was so tough that it took both of my hands to squeeze the peas out.  And, the server tried to take my edamame away before I was even halfway finished trying to ply the peas away from the pods.  Just because it was a chore to eat didn't mean I wanted to give up on it.    In addition, I noted that a simple glass of house Chardonnay is a whopping $9!!  Yikes!    The article I read about Rai Lay characterized it as a place where servers explain the ""street food"" dishes with diners and work with diners on degrees of heat.  Not so during my experience.  I asked my server if the grilled pork salad was hot and spicy, and he said, ""I don't think so.""   I replied, ""Good, I'll take it if it isn't spicy.""  When the dish (which was actually quite pretty to look at) arrived, it had a full pepper jetting out from it, and it was littered with pepper flakes.  While the pork was really good, it was so hot that tears were rolling down my cheeks.  The star of the show (something you don't see in everyday Thai restaurants), is sticky rice served in a basket.  Granted, the rice was surrounded in plastic wrap to keep it piping hot (as opposed to a banana leaf), but the concept was nice and different.    The ""Thai Street Food"" concept seems like a gimmick to me in order to get people in the door.  It worked because I went.  But if the menu or the servers don't really indicate the difference between ""Thai Street Food"" and food from other Thai restaurants, then the gimmick could just as well be ""Free Parking.""  When I visited, it was at a time when only a few other diners were there, so there was no excuse for an experience which I expected would be educational but, instead, was just a little less than ordinary.",neutral

"Ok, so I went here with my Mom and a group of people for her birthday.  The drinks were good, I'm under 21 so I had a raspberry iced tea, which was good, and everyone that had wine or beer thought it was a great selection.  For an appetizer I tried the chicken wings, which were huge (bigger than my fist) and very delicious, being only $5 on the happy hour menu, it was a great deal. It came with 3 wings.  For my entree I tried the chile rubbed mejor steak.  It was $20, and the disappointment was bigger than the steak.  The steak was smaller than the chicken wings were, with even less flavor.  I honestly don't even know how they removed as much flavor as they possibly could from their steak.  The size of the steak alone made me want to leave upon looking at it, but the hopes of flavor kept me going, only to end up wanting to cry in the spiciest mashed potatoes I have ever had.    In the end, I wish I had only had more of the chicken wings.  The drinks, wings, and service were the only things that kept me from getting too upset.  At the time.  This happened a few weeks ago and I wasn't going to write a review, but I've had this eating at me and pissing me off at random times.  I WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN.  If you're a steak fan, I wouldn't go here.  The chicken wings were the only things on the menu that looked appetizing to me.",neutral

"As mentioned by several other reviewers, my B Good experience was just 'B Okay'.   As a first-timer, I decided to go for their seasonal summer burger. It had a roasted corn salsa, bacon, & avocado on it. The flavor or of the burger was great, but the burger itself was small (i.e. a lot of extra bun around the edges) and overcooked. Had this been a nice juicy burger, this would have definitely warranted a 4-star review. I also think $8 for a burger only (had to pay $1.25 on top of that to add cheese) is steel for a fast casual place. That is honestly sit down price for me, so I'd be hesistant to come back based on that alone. After adding on $3.xx for some sweet potato fries, my meal came to about $14. Again, that's sit-down restaurant pricing.   My wife had gotten one of the quinoa salad/bowl meals, and hers was great. I would steer that route if you're keen on eating here. Sandwiches are definitely not work the hype or expense.   Side note: WHO DOESN'T CARRY RANCH DRESSING?!

"First of all, I'm not that fond of sushi. But my wife is. And I try to be a gentleman. So I often go to sushi island. It's not bad I must say. One of the highlights is the range of choice in the all-you-can-eat menu. They have sushis with brown rice, with all kind of tempuras, with all kind of fish, all kind of meat (yes meat). They even have a sushi-pizza and sweet sushis. OK for you Torontonian that may seem normal but for a frenchman it's rice-christmas! Our sushis contain salmon or tuna, seeweed, sometimes, and avocado if the place is really wild. Other plus, the stuff is good! I read that another reviewer can easily come up with 10 sushis place better than this one. I'd love to try them. As I said I am not a sushi connaisseur, but these are definitively the best I had in Toronto. Downsides now. First the service. Not the fact that they are not smiling. I'm coming from Paris, I kind of like that. But, first, because they try to make you drink tons of tea or water so that the rice expands in your stomach and you leave with a full belly that will seems empty one hour later, and, second, because they put a really nasty pressure on you so that you leave quickly your table. Not the usual 'no rush' that means exactly the contrary but insistant stare-down that tells you that if you don't exit right now the chef is going to come and use you as raw material for his brand new type of sushi. Coming with white or brown rice, tempura and gallons of tea...",neutral

Since the shrimp ceviche was $9.99,  I expected a bowl of shrimp that had been marinated in citrus.  Instead I got a bowl of salsa with 4 shrimp in it.  While the salsa was tasty it wasn't worth the price.  If that is the way they want to serve it they should give you a side of tortilla chips instead of saltine packages.  My husband ordered a Club.  It was good and the bread was delicious.  Nice atmosphere. We ate outside and enjoyed the lovely AZ weather.",neutral

"Pretty good. I've had better, but this is probably the closest crepe place near where I live and I don't see a reason to not be a returning guest.  When ordering sweet crepes, you get to choose a flavor and 2 fruits of your choice. They also give you an option for a different type of batter as well; red velvet, whole wheat (I think it was), and regular. Ice cream is an additional $1. I went with a regular Nutella crepe with strawberry and banana. The crepes are pretty huge and they fill it with whatever fruit you chose. And they definitely don't skimp out on the fruit too, so that's a plus.  I also ordered an iced Nutella latte, which I could've don't without lol.  The ladies behind the counter were really nice though. Super friendly and quick with their service.",neutral
Overall pleasant stay but nothing spectacular to call out. Rooms seem to have received a minor facelift in the past couple of years.

We both ordered the short ribs and since the mashed potatoes weren't ready we were able to get the risotto or potatoes au gratin and a choice of broccolini or seasonal vegetables.  We choose the broccolini and risotto with the short ribs.  All was delivered fairly soon and looked appetizing.  The flavor was decent but the texture of the short ribs wasn't fork tender like I expected.  All the food was only luke warm not hot.  I prefer my food hot but didn't want to send it back.

My husband ordered the burger; my sister the polenta & bro-in-law the salmon. We all really enjoyed our food & wine. The portions are big, so a very filling lunch. There are lighter (salad/soup) options too.  The main reason I gave Union 3-stars and not 4 is that they need to work on their interior temperature control. There was no barrier between the front door and the seating area except a flimsy curtain that was constantly being opened. So with the -20C outside it made for a uncomfortably frigid meal experience. Folks at the front bar were fully bundled up in coats while drinking. If they are trying to go for the Ice Hotel experience they hit the nail on the head.

"The food  is good. You will not be disappointed. The staff is friendly. The menu is not very surprising. I can't say it is an amazing restaurant. It is just good and overpriced for what they offer. I ordered a meal number 45. I got noodles, 4 pieces of crab, a tiny piece of beef and a tiny spring roll. The size was just right to feel not hungry, but not too full. It tasted really good. But for almost 13$ you sort of expect a little more than noodles, 4 crabs, a tiny roll and a tiny piece of meat. The meal literally cost them not more than 1.50$ -2$ to prepare.  I wished they had more soup varieties in smaller bowls as entrees. I don't want to pay 10$ and get a huge soup as I don;t always like to make a soup to my main dish. Also, I wished they had more authentic salads, like a lotus stem salad.

I'd almost rather pick another show to be honest with you.  I disliked the forced pictures and thought the video trailer for the show was dumb - proving to me I should still stay seated in the theater and not walk out... pointless.   The show is cute - not really vegas quality but I still didn't know how things were done.  There were special guests that I quite enjoyed - it was almost like a variety show in a way.

"Guys, don't throw stones at me.  I LIKED Barrington's.  I would give them a solid 3.8 stars.  They are better than ""Ok"" but not as good as ""yay I'm a fan.""  As others have stated, the ambiance is quaint, quiet, intimate.  I love that.  The service was OK for us.  The waitress seemed a little ""rough"" and just didn't provided the polished professionalism you would expect at a place like this.  She had a couple of recommendations for wine based on the description of what I wanted and I think she provided decent options but neither truly hit the spot.    I ordered the butternut squash soup and one of the salads.  Both were done very well and I liked that I could order a ""half order"" so it wasn't too much and I wasn't too full before my entrΓ©e.  I went with the swordfish for my main meal.  It was OK.  It had a crispy crust around it but the fish itself was pretty fishy.  The menu said it came with white beans, broccoli rabe and chorizo.  You couldn't really taste or find many pieces of chorizo and for some reason the flavor combinations didn't work THAT well.  I mostly just tasted fishy fish with bitter broccoli.  The truffled mashed potatoes were amazing but they came out lukewarm which was disappointing.    We went against our server's recommendations (as she had suggested a couple other things we didn't agree with earlier in the evening) and decided to try the blueberry sticky bun and the smore's crΓ¨me brulee.  Both get an A for effort, NO doubt.  They both get an A for creativity as well.  They both get a B in terms of flavor and overall enjoyment.    I just don't feel confident to say this is the best restaurant in Charlotte.  I have had better dining experiences elsewhere.

And since my flights are regularly delayed, I hate relying on someone else to drop me off and then pick me up from the airport, especially when I don't know what time I'm actually landing. The resolution? Use the economy lot at LAS. The area seems relatively safe. I'm not sure if it's regularly security patrolled, but at least the shuttles are driving around the area often enough and keeping their eyes peeled. The charge is $10/day that can be paid by either cash or card upon exit. Do yourself a favor and remember the lot area you are at since the shuttle taking you to the airport will ask you and you know where to go to get your car later. It's always a good idea to take a photo of the lot area and the blurred # on the ground if you can. The shuttles come pretty frequently to take you to the airport, but they can fill-up and the shuttle drivers will not allow anyone to stand inside the shuttle. Have a couple of bucks handy to tip the driver, especially if they are loading luggage in the back for you. I haven't had an issue with luggage being taken by someone else, but again, I'm a paranoid person who puts a bunch of ridiculous things on their luggage to distinguish it from anyone else's luggage then peers out the window as people leave to make sure they didn't take my luggage. The only time I don't like parking out here is over the summer, when the sun is beaming down hard, so I'll make my way to regular and expensive covered parking ($14/day). During the holidays and other peak travelling times, spaces may be hard to come by, so prepare to drive towards the end of the lot to find vacancies.",neutral

"Second time here. They are open 24 hours a day! My bf and I met friends here last night. They have a nice outdoor seatings but the weather was cold.  They have a good choice of craft beers in Las Vegas and better selection of quality beers. The waitress says the beers on tap on the menu changes every three days. They also do events so check their website for current tap list and special events.  If you like video poker then this is also a very ok place to hang out.  They have a discount at happy hour.  I had a glass of Riesling. My friends had Nachos and cheese. We tried Candied bacon, it tasted like Teriyaki bacon and we didn't like it.   The music was loud and noise level was high.  Our waitress is very attentive and friendly.  Overall, this is a pretty average bar. I don't feel like there's a real reason to go out of your way to come here, but if you're in the area then it's worth a visit.",neutral

The inside of this place still looks exactly like the restaurant that was previously there. The staff was nice. The food we ordered was bland. No flavor.  Very basic. I ordered from their breakfast menu. Got the basics. Eggs, toast, grits and bacon. My husband ordered off the lunch menu and got some sort of sandwich. I can't remember what he ordered exactly but it was like a French dip sandwich. He also said it was pretty tasteless. We may try this place again. The prices were great. Maybe we will try something else on the menu next time.",neutral

"We looked up reviews on yelp for a place to eat and this place had great reviews and the pictures of the food looked great so, not being from Rock Hill we thought we would give it a try.  The pub was not very busy when we went in about 6:45pm, we had plenty of tables to choose from.  We was handed our menus and the waitress took our drink orders.  When she brought our drinks we placed an order for the spinach cheese dip for an appitizer, she looked at us and asked, ""so, you want me to put that order in now?"".  Ummm....yes please.  When the spinach cheese dip came to table we had to ask for silverware and napkins, and we placed our order, this is about 7:15pm.  I do not think we recieved the right appitizer, it was a cheese dip but there was no spinach, we was all very hungry from our trip so we was willing to try it, it was really good.  So, we didn't say anything about the wrong order.  Our order was 3 different chicken wraps one with fries, one with tator tots and one with onion rings and 4th order was a grilled chicken salad.  We did not get our food until a few minutes past 8pm.  I sincerely thought they lost our order and we was getting ready to leave when our food came to the table. Our food was cold; the fries, tots or onion rings.  I'm sure they would have been really good hot and fresh but cold and greasy was not good at all.  Our wraps was a good size, we was so hungry we ate the wraps, even cold the sauce on the chicken was amazing!  One had teriyaki sauce and one had cajun sauce, 3rd was Mediterranean, our daughter said it was good.  Other daughter had the salad, thank goodness the salad came out cold, LOL, she said her salad was good.  So, this place would have recieved 5 stars had it not been for the bad waitress and cold food.  If they ever figure out how to fix those small problems this place would probably be one of the best in Rock Hill.  The amout of sauce options for wings (also the chicken wrap) was amazing!  We have family in town so the next time we visit we will probably give it another chance.  We love mom and pop restaurants, we prefer to support local businesses wherever we go.  I hope next time I can change my review and give the 5 stars they probably deserve.",neutral

"Not the best, but it does the trick.   I walk-in with sunglasses on, a hoodie pulled over my head, and a docile demeanor. Nope, I'm not trying to rob the place of money, just of it's delicious burritos and as many salsas as I can fit in my burrito bag.   Robertos is not the best Mexican food in Vegas. Hell, if might even be number twenty-two on my list of ""A-OK"" Mexican fast food places in the valley, but what this Robertos location does have that I love, as they say in real estate... location, location, location. I can pretty much walk here from my house. I came here after a raucous night at Yelp club night event that ended up going back to Henderson and resulted in me going to bed at 4am.   As I stare at the blurry menu, I zero-in on the Adobada Burrito. My main go-to when I need food meds to cure what ails me. If you haven't had Adobada Burrito it's basically chunks of slowly cooked pork in a red chile sauce, sometimes served with pineapples, and wrapped in tasty warm blanket of flattened bread, and paired with a guacamole/salsa mixture. This really is all you need, stop fussing about with rice and beans, pure filler! Stick with the basics, meat, veggies, and bread.   Anyone who doesn't think this place is fast food location is wrong. By the time I put in my order and walked over to the salsa counter, my burrito was already wrapped up and ready for consumption. That's pretty damn fast to me and under $6, sold.   BTW - The burrito was great and I took a nap immediately after. Food coma power down.",neutral

What dish they can improve on: Duck tacos - go easy on the sour cream!

Why they didn't get four stars: No beers on tap!",neutral

"I am stuck between 3 and 4 - I would give Notorious Burgers a 3-3.5 (A-OK or better) and my boyfriend would give it a 4 (yay! he's a fan!).   I did like the decor entering through the front, but something felt a tiny off in the back main dining room. I can't put my finger on it. Maybe just because it is so dark.   The waitstaff and manager we SO very nice. They were attentive, kind and really really nice. 5 stars on that.   The chocolate shake was good, a bit rich. They don't bring you the extra, just the part of shake that fits into the jar. I should have asked for it at the same time as my food, it was a little runny by the time the food came. My fault.   My boyfriend loved his burger (something with bacon). My cheeseburger was pretty good, nothing life changing, but good. The bun was a little dry - I think that was the biggest drawback.   The fries were not great at all, they were kind of hard - like overcooked (not burnt, just hard, not crispy, but hard).   The cheese curds are probably amazing to 99% of people, but since I don't drink or like the taste of beer, I didn't like them as they are beer battered. I bet you for anyone else though, they would just die over these cheese curds. mmmm.   Overall, our lunch was over $50, which is pretty expensive for just ok/good.

"The location is great - located on Unionville Main Street, it's a good Mexican food option for those that frequent the area or are visiting for the first time. The restaurant is small but cozy and they have a small patio perfect for warmer days. When my friend and I went on a Friday for lunch, the place was empty - we were the only customers until a party of four entered towards the end of our meal. All tortilla entrees come with Mexican fried rice, refried beans, and pico de gallo. We ordered steak quesadillas ($11.50 excl. tax): a flour tortilla with feta cheese and chipotle sauce or sour cream and steak enchiladas ($13.50 excl. tax) with mild sauce: three rolled tortillas with feta and sour cream. My friend loved the steak quesadillas and would give them a 4/5. I thought the enchiladas were just okay - a 2.5 or 3/5 at best. The enchiladas' mild sauce was too sour in my opinion and because the enchiladas are covered with a generous amount of it (the amount is a good thing, the flavour of the salsa not so much), I didn't find myself enjoying the dish too much. Overall, Planeta Mexico is a good Mexican food place. The service is super friendly and accommodating. I'd go again if I was craving Mexican and happened to be on Main Street but it's not a place I'd seek out.",neutral

The neighborhood that the restaurant is located in gave me a sense of impending danger and my girlfriend say she's into bad boys so I think I turned her on when We came into this joint.   The food was OK. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just Mexican food, you know?  Walking out of this restaurant, I feel like a man for once in my life. I took a selfie with La Santissima in the background and sent it to my friends.   When I was walking to my car a homeless person slapped the glasses out of my face...I mean I didn't need them to see, those were sunglasses. I probably shouldn't have worn them at night anyway. I just wanted to be cool and also I wanted to call the police but I sensed some heat coming from between my girlfriends legs so we ended up making out in the parking lot next to the shipping container.

"So I've been on a Vietnamese food kick for the last three days. I was weary about this place as soon as I sat down and saw that there was not a pair of chopsticks in sight. Even the people eating pho were using forks.  WTH?  Service was quick and no nonsense. When you're done with your meal, go to the counter to pay.  I forgot I was in the French side of town so my not understanding what the waitress was saying in English seemed to annoy her. I know, I know...I should be learning French. One day, people!    I enjoyed the people watching very much today. My favorite was the man with a red bamboo fan, fanning himself at the table. It WAS a fairly warm day.  Or was it the combination of the heat and eating pho?  Does he always carry a fan with him or was it for pho?  Regardless, it matched his outfit so bravo to him for accessorizing well.   Despite my suspicion, I was very happy with what I ordered. Bun with chicken, shrimp skewers and egg roll. Everyone 's food looked amazing though.

"We visited Mac's for the first time tonight.  I'd often wondered how it was, but it's nearly impossible to lure my husband away from the ceasar salad at Wildflower.  But this weekend, Mac's is participating in Hoodstock and donating 10% of it's proceeds to my stepdaughter's school, so we gave it a try.    We waited for about 15 minutes for a table, but were able to get a snack for our girls and a couple beers while we waited.  Toddler meltdown averted.  RIght when they seated us, some friends of ours came in, also looking to have dinner.  We asked if our table could accommodate three more people and another baby, and since it couldn't they opened a bigger table for us in the back.  Pretty cool, if you ask me.  Once we ordered, it took a while for our food to get to us.  In their defense though, I think they were pretty slammed with additional business coming in from Hoodstock next door.  I ordered the spicy roast beef, my husband had the a California chicken sandwich (something along those lines) and our girls split some fish and chips (hold the chips, sub a side of fruit).  The spicy roast beef is no joke.  Now, I'm no stranger to spice.  I like my wings HOT, I add extra tabasco to my bloody Mary's, hell, I ate hot sauce straight out of the bottle when I was pregnant.  But this sandwich took it overboard.  Heat can be a good thing, but not when it's the ONLY THING you can feel in your mouth.  I couldn't even taste anything else in the sandwich.  Finally, I picked off the jalapenos and it was much more tolerable.  My husbands chicken sandwich was great, and the girls fish was mediocre.  Not the best, not the worst, but pretty good.  I'm not a fan of skinny little french fries.  There's just not enough potato for me.    But, the service was fine, considering it was a packed house with big parties and lots of kids in there.  And I have to give them props for donating money to Broadmor.  Next time we're in the area and in the mood for some eats and drinks, we'll stop in again.",neutral
"Great service. Naveed was our server and he was great. The service greatly compensated for everything else, which is why I rate this a 3. Food took a while and it was average. Steak was too fatty.

"Upon arriving in an extremely cold 34 degrees day in Las Vegas, my sister-in-law, brought us here to eat lunch. After waiting for about 10-15 minutes in line, we were finally seated and allowed to explore and eat our hearts out. Knowing how carbs can quickly fill me up, I went straight for the good ol' BBQ protein and meat section (only because they did not serve crab legs for lunch). I got their chicken, ribs, kielbasa sausage and prime rib. It was OK at best. After that first plate, I went to the fried stuff, hush puppies, onion rings and other fried foods that I can't even remember. After scarfing my second food of plate, I decided to take a break and assess how much more food I can take. After a few minutes, I decided to take a stroll to the lines of food one last time. I wanted to try some pastas and Italian foods but it looked so messy that I resisted the urge. Their Asian food section had the traditional westernized Asian food so I stayed away from them as well, I decided to take some cocktail shrimps which were surprisingly good, but not great. Finally, I went to get my main meal of the day:desserts. I got the tiramisu and cookies and cream gelato, and some other sweet treats which, again, was OK. The only other thing I thought was good was that my drink was always filled every time I came back from getting another plate of food. I'm really glad that my expectations with buffets wasn't that high because this place was OK at best. Thus the 3 star rating...",neutral

"Change is bad. Everyone knows it. You know it. I know it. Fish know it, plants know it, your boss lies to you, but he/she knows it too.  I was at Taro's today for what is surely the best non high-end restaurant sushi in Canada and they have removed the counters, stools and seats to force people not to eat there. Since everyone knows take-out sushi is as nice and palatable as three-day old cake it seems this will be my last visit to Taro's. I am not sure why they dislike and disdain the customers who took advantage of their seats and counters, because clearly putting bags of rice on the counter and taking away the chairs means you did not really need the space, but made sure you fill it with something else on purpose, but that is a loss to the customer and the business. The sushi menu is still there, but only amateurs or people who live next door (!?!?!) will buy sushi there now. So they have the sushi but want to send it out of the store only. Sorry, cold sushi sitting in the car for an hour is as cool as a SUV or four-door Porsche. Ladies automatically know that stuff.  The store is still selling packaged and whole fish, Japanese edibles and garnish of course. For those who do not enjoy standing in line Mr. Taro also now sells Japanese cheesecake and matcha cake too (see they are uptown but they know business and how to make money on the back of a trend), but gone is the ability to order rolls, sushi, sashimi, clams and even tempura and enjoy it there.  It is too bad because I always picked up something there whenever I visited. Whether fish, ready-made food, oden (which they don't care any more) or soy sauce I will pick those things up elsewhere as well.  See, I told you, change is bad. That is why corporations and hypocrite types always have to repeat the lie that 'change is good' or 'change is for the better' or 'change is needed' etc. If it were true it would not needed constant preaching.   As I was getting in the car I noticed that the kabob place two doors down has an amber 'conditional pass' from the city. I clearly won't be eating there either...",neutral
Just OK. I got the arugula salad and the gnocchi and the other one of us got the brick flattened chicken. The food was pretty good but all the vegetables they claimed to come with were chopped so fine that they were lost in sauce land. So I had just gnocchi and he had just chicken. The food was still good but after the hour and ten minutes it took a I come out I was hoping it would be well worth the wait. It was probably an extra long hour plus because I couldn't hear the person I was sitting with as this place appears to draw in a loud Case Western crowd. Glad I gave this place a try but probably won't be back. There are just too many Italian places within 15-20 minutes that blows this place out of the water.,neutral

"Review is based on two visits to Pinky. Both times I came with a friend and we did walk-ins without appointments. Most recently I came yesterday (a Monday) and didn't have to wait at all, but the time before that they were busier and we had to wait about half an hour. They have a good selection of regular polishes (which are very well organized) as well as shellac and OPI gel. However, sometimes they are running low on some colours (i.e. last time I was asked to select a different colour because the nail tech didn't think there would be enough to cover all my nails...?) and also the colours on their shellac wheel are kind of faded and not accurate - was surprised when they brought out some of the bottles and the colours were not even close to what I thought I picked! But luckily they were accommodating and let me change my mind a few times.  Both times I came, I got a shellac mani and got a regular pedi as well once. For what I can see, the service is kind of hit or miss. Some of the people there are super friendly, but some of them are definitely more reserved and/or have some attitude. The first time I got a male technician who seemed nice enough, but I think didn't speak much English and was a bit klutzy. The second time I got a girl who seemed very proficient at her job, but gave me some attitude when I asked if she could file my nails shorter after she had finished doing one hand - if she had asked me before she went ahead and did all my nails, I would have put in the request sooner!  That being said, there are definitely a few things I do like especially about Pinky. The services are very thorough, as in, for the pedicure they take the time to scrub and massage your legs, which not all other places do, and which I really really liked. Same with the manicure, I like that they moisturize your arms and hands and massage in the lotion. You also get a back massage, which is pretty cool if you're into that stuff - I do wish they would ask you before they just go ahead and start touching you though.  In terms of the actual mani/pedi, the quality is pretty good, and I didn't have issues with my shellac chipping or anything the first time. It is a bit pricey and unlike some other places they charge tax on top. I don't see this becoming my go-to place, but it's a decent nail salon in downtown Toronto.",neutral

"The best reason to go to Trader Vic's is the drinks.  Rum makes an appearance in most of them and they're all kitschy and delicious.  Some are more alcohol-tasting than others, and the mai tais are wonderful. The coconut-looking glasses are a hoot.  As for the food, my four companions and I all agreed that it was overpriced for the quality.  I had the fried rice, which was good, but not really any better than what you'd get from a good Chinese restaurant. For the $20 I paid for it, I certainly expected that the shrimp would be of a bigger size than a quarter.  It was disappointing.  One of my companions ordered the salmon, which she said was good, but not necessarily any better than what she could have grilled herself.  We got the dessert sampler, as well.  The idea of 'a little of everything' is a great one, and more restaurants should do it.  However, the creme brulee didn't have that nicely fired crust on the top that it should have.  If  you're staying at The Valley Ho and want a quick stumble back to your room after too many Suffering Bastards, I'd recommend it.  Otherwise, I'm sure there are better restaurants in Scottsdale.  Go to Vic's for the drinks and dinner elsewhere.",neutral

"As an out of towner I was excited to check this place out. Our dear friends had brought me a pound of their beans which I thoroughly enjoyed. The ambiance is unique and noteworthy. I tried a cheddar jalapeΓ±o muffin which was a nice blend of sweet and savory. The coffee on the other hand was underwhelming. I got a whiteout cappuccino and my wife got a vanilla latte. Upon tasting the espresso in both drinks, I could taste an unpleasant bitterness which I describe as chemical or turpentine. This usually means the beans were improperly roasted. I also think the microfoam on the cappuccino could have been prepared better as it was more bubbly than a good cappuccino normally has.   I could have visited on an off day as I know I have had good beans from here before. Off days happen sometimes.",neutral

"We don't stay in KOA parks often because they tend to be higher in price than other (and sometimes better) parks in the area. We stopped at this one to be close to family we were going to visit.   The Las Vegas KOA at Sam's Town is a destination park. We rate parks as destination when you are staying at the park to visit the surrounding area and not for what the park offers or a park where they have big pools, spas, activities and/or golf courses. Both have their place but usually not when other parks in the same town have both for a similar price. Maybe, they think the casino is the draw-it is a short walk.   We paid approximately $50 per night for the site. It is really a parking lot with sites and some trees, which are the best part. The sites are small gravel which tracks into everything.  We did have a tree that shaded for part of the day which was nice. Most did not have that kind of tree. The reason for the 3 star is that the sites are so close that you can see into the windows of the next RV, if you didn't keep your shades down. Way too close. They walk out to leave and are inches from your place.   I doubt if we would stay here again. We usually stay on the other side of town and I would definitely select that park over this one. It is definitely nicer with a few large pools and small but useable gym.  And room to breathe!",neutral

"Easily one of the most overrated burgers I've had in my life. I can't handle more than a slice of American 'cheese', so that seems to knock off a good portion of the menu (I'm looking at you, ""double double""). Their beef is pretty darn good, but good luck savoring that, as it's overwhelmed by what is practically a salad between the buns. At least they're toasted to perfection.  Also, the fries blow. Yeah yeah, there's no trans fat! They're freshly cut potatoes! DGAF, it's not like anyone has health or freshness on the mind at a fast food joint. The novelty of the great ingredients wears off when you realize every item is the same. Ooh, animal style...who can actually finish off that monstrosity? Who would *want* to?  I stick with something simple. A nice hamburger with grilled onions. It leaves me content, but not anywhere near the foodgasm I hear California transplants raving about.  The pros: -Clean -Open lobby 'til 1AM -Quality ingredients  The bad: -15 minutes for one damned hamburger -No variety (unless you feel like adding more fat) -Fries are lackluster -Thousand Island or GTFO   They WOULD get two stars, but their business practices are too groovy for that.

"It is to bad that Sin City brewing does not have a location other than a little alcove off the Miracle Mile shopping walk.

Usually I'm a bit weary about ordering salmon as the texture can come out weird if not cooked right but I've never had a problem here.

"Likes: Good dilworth location, little to no wait for a table, food served quickly, mimosas and bellinis are delicious and a good size for the price    Gripes: Omelets are odd. The eggs are fully cooked and then the other ingredients - cheese, vegis, etc - are entirely separate from the eggs and just folded in between plain cooked eggs. I have never had omelets like this anywhere else and the food came out so quickly that it makes me wonder if the eggs are not precooked and they just stuff the ingredients in when the order is placed. Bloody marys are mediocre. At my most recent visit, our one particular server was rude but I have not experienced this before so I am not sure what to make of that.   Bottom line: If you're in the area, it's a good place to grab a decent breakfast but this is not a restaurant that I would seek out.",neutral

"When I found out that my coworkers love Pho I started disliking them a little less. Just kidding! (in case they read my reviews, lets not make this awkward for everyone).  They were raving about this Pho place really close to work, so we decided to make a lunch trip and reserve a table for 8. When we arrived at noon, we found a mob of pretty disgruntled people inside, waiting to be seated. I quietly asked if they had put their name down or anything and was cut off by a lady in full rage about being ""in line"" for a table because no one had taken her name down.  To anger the lady even further, I grabbed a server and let her know we had a reservation for 8, in which we were immediately seated in the first 2 available 4-person booths. Unfortunately for me, I was facing the angry lady. Sorry yo- we made reservations. *awkwardly looks away*.  Although this Pho place serves a pretty big Thai menu (WTF?) I figured going for traditional Vietnamese pho was the way to go. I got my usual round-eye steak and brisket pho while my coworkers went for the #1 ""all the meat"" Pho. Our food came soon enough and after drowning it in herbs, lime juice and chili sauce, we dug in.    I have to say I have no complaints about the taste of the Pho but I can't dare give it 5 stars. It was tasty (as Pho usually is), but the broth wasn't particularly aromatic or flavorful and the meat was not good quality.  Was it tasty? Yes. Would I eat it again? Sure. Would I take people here over other pho places in the area? No way. There are way tastier places with better components nearby. At $8 it was a decent lunch, but nothing to rave my fellow Yelpers about.",neutral

"Came here for a bachelorette party last Saturday night with my 4 girlfriends. We got there after 10 pm and were able to skip the line and the cover charge (they have a Ladies Line). Once inside we were offered seating in the VIP area which was amazing! They even let us dance up on a platform. Unfortunately, that fairy tale ended when someone actually purchased the table, but it was fun while it lasted. The staff in and around the VIP area were very cool and accommodating even though we hadn't paid to be there.  The bartender mixed a nice strong Patron margarita, and I didn't think $14 was too bad a price for that considering Bud Lights were $10. I'll pay the extra $4 and get top shelf liquor, thanks. The DJ played really good music; kind of a top 40/hip hop/dance mash-up. The only thing was, like others have said, he would switch songs too soon and there were a few times the whole club stopped dancing because there wasn't a good beat going. Side note: the music was extremely loud. It took a good hour after we left for my ears to stop ringing. Not a complaint, just a comment. The bouncers outside the VIP area weren't quite so cool, and them waving their little flashlights around got annoying (major power trip). All in all, this was a better club experience than I've had in the past, although that is probably because in the past I've always had guys with me and this time I was with a group of ladies.

"This location is fortunate to have Caleb as an associate. He's the reason this store has gotten any stars from me.  He alone delivers 5 star customer service whereas a colleague of his was more interested in being right than anything else.  I'll try to keep it short.  We were looking for a door latch that is fitted for older doors.  An adjustable one.  The colleague whose department is locks and hardware was adamant that all door handles only come in adjustable latches that fit standard door sizes.  Never once said that it's possible to buy just the latch and have it fit to a door handle/knob. Never once looked up any items that would fit the description.  Caleb on the other hand opened door handle boxes with me, asked another associate that would be more knowledgable and then looked online. The associate he spoke to understood what I was looking for and  He found the product I was looking for at a competitor's location. All the while he was calm, professional and helpful.    Otherwise, it's a hit or miss here.  We've shopped at this location, no word of a lie, at least 30 times in the last 6 months as we are doing renovations.  Anyway, there are a few gems that work at this location and one can find most of what you need for your home and garden.",neutral
"Love the industrial vibe of the place. Love the servers, some of the nicest I've ever come across. Love the menu, as everything is mouthwatering, or close to it.  Food comes out lightning fast, like you're still wondering if you ordered the right stuff, and bam! there it is, leaving you to decide by looking at it. The flavors are also spot on. Even the televisions nail it (at least when we were there), with some Asian game shows, along the lines of MXC, subtitles and everything. Nice.  What isn't quite right is the execution of the dishes.  - Ramen mac & cheese: Flavor was good while warm, but unfortunately after a minute or two, that cheese turns into a government cheese glop, which is not attractive at all. The crispy pork skins added nice texture, until dissolving into the glop.  - Wings (specifically soy garlic, but I suspect on others): The flavor was again spot on, but the breading was so thick, it was tough to get at the meat below. I think this was a breading and not some alien, radioactive Troma-movie like super-thick skin, but I really don't know. Our son loved them, however.  - Pork belly: great flavor, but totally mixed textures. The meat was great. The fatty portions, in bits, was good. The cracklins were often too tough to eat due to fear of breaking a tooth. Next time, the pulled pork would probably make a better choice.  - Buns: Related to above, trying to make sandwiches with pork belly (and other items) was a good choice, and with pulled pork, would probably be an excellent decision.  - Sweet potato swirl: Again, amazing flavor, but one of the oddest things I've ever eaten. If you can get any to your mouth, it dissolves in cloudy goodness, but getting it there is a challenge. Bonus: If you save it, take it home and chill it in the fridge, it becomes a lot easier to eat (though you still get the stickiness of the sauce on your fingers).  - Potato swirl on a stick: Also great flavors, but a little unwieldy, not quite as bad as the sweet potato however. At this point, we were just slowing down. Had as an appetizer, this would have probably been better.  End result: Amazing flavors, even presentation is great.

"Checked in earlier today. The young woman at the desk, yesenia, deserves five stars. She was great. Polite, friendly, outgoing, professional, all the things customer service should be. I wanted to say that first. I might bump up a star just for her service. Now on to the rest of the hotel.  I'm an IHG rewards member and travel frequently. I like to try all different hotels in the IHG family, but tend to stray away from Holiday Inn. But the wife and I didn't feel like staying home or leaving town, and Holiday Inn is the only IHG in Surprise, so I booked a king room and off we went. This is a fairly new hotel and from the outside it looked nice and I had a pretty standard level of expectations. Check in went quick, but I always try to stay on the top floor (hate footsteps above me while I try to sleep) and couldn't, or I could, but the front desk clerk told me that's where the baseball team they house stays and it would be ""really loud"" uh...okay I guess. If they'll be loud next to me, won't they be loud above me? But fine, second floor it is. Not a big deal or a complaint, just kind of weird. The room itself is a pretty standard size for a hotel room but for a king bed the bed was particularly small and not very comfortable. The room had extremely visible wear on the scratched furniture and wall which is strange for a new hotel. We got a rather unappealing view as well. The room was warm but the A/C worked fine and the room was overall clean. Huge mirror in the bathroom, standard amenities. Oh, and the pool is TINY. Really small. And not well taken care of as other reviews have mentioned. However, it's close to everything there is to do in surprise including library, stadium, water park (public pool with a water slide), shops, etc. Overall, I wouldn't book the hotel again if I have the choice, but if I'm staying in Surprise I'd stay again solely out of loyalty to IHG.",neutral

"I'm doing three stars for now until I visit again. We went on a Sunday a little after lunch time and there was barely anyone in there on the gorgeous day. We got to sit near the garage doors and enjoyed the atmosphere immensely!  For a really small crowd the drinks took a long time, that makes me nervous for when they are really busy.  The food and drinks are great though....expensive but thats expected in their prime location. They only serve homemade corn tortillas which I'm not a huge fan of so its difficult to find alternative options in such a limited menu. However, the tostada looked amazing that my sister got and I would totally smash that next time! The chips and salsa are generous portions for the price and the chips came out warm and crispy! Drinks....wow they are fresh and flavorful. The sangria and bakersfield margarita were to die for. Not too sweet but still full of fruity flavor.  We will come back, gorgeous interior and great location a little way off from the hustle and bustle by west side market. Having indoor/outdoor seating is a plus and our server was friendly!",neutral

"I have never ordered a pizza from here, I have only stopped in for by the slice goodness.   Small pizza joint, not aimed at sitting down. They have a by the slice thing and the rest is take out/delivery. There are usually a few kinds of by the slice 'za kicking around at lunch time, I usually stick to the usual suspects: hawaiian, pep, or cheese. I have to agree, the sauce is not great - it's too sweet and lacks the flavour required to compliment such a nice crust. There's nothing really wow about this stuff, other than the fluffy crust. If you're down with that - down with carb city - and want a filling lunch that will stave off the 3:30pm hunger pangs (and replace them with carbo groggines), this place has got you covered.   There's really no where to sit, they have a few chairs for waiting but I would feel odd eating there. Plan to get this on a nice day so you can pull up a patch of grass, or take it back to work, or take it away....

I went with the Parmesan-crusted chicken sandwich, a chicken breast coated with Parmesan bread crumbs and served between a soft roll with lettuce, tomato, and a garlic dressing. A little heavy on the lettuce and tomato and light on the coating, but a good sandwich with particularly good thin-cut fries.

"This place was recommended to me months ago, but I never had the chance to check it out until now. The deli side has a large menu hanging above the counter advertising sandwiches and such. Boar's Head is proudly displayed throughout which gave me some high hopes. The counter underneath was empty for the most part except for a rack of ribs that were available for purchase.  A gentleman came up to the front from the kitchen area and motioned for me to join him at the end of the counter. There on the counter was the full menu with additional items (Burgers) and a sheet with ""temporary hours."" Those new hours are from 11am-7pm. I went with a pastrami sandwich to go and while waiting for the sandwich, I checked out the butcher section of the shop.  Sandwich is very delicious! There was some difficulty keeping the sandwich together while eating, but I am okay with a messy sandwich. Coleslaw was a little on the bland side, but didn't take away from the sandwich much.

"This review is only for the bar/lounge area.  I haven't stayed at the hotel, so I can't say what the rooms/prices/service is like.  I went to the lounge here only because my most favorite bartender in the world started working here, and I would follow him anywhere.    It's very different from the usual places I frequent.  First of all, the lounge area is very small and within throwing distance of the front desk, the restaurant seating area, and even some of the hotel rooms.  I like my lounges a little more secluded.  Second, the two or three times I've been, the DJ has been playing some hip-hop/80s/techno music.  It's almost like they want the place to have a club-y vibe, while I like my music a little more chill.  The decor could be described as bright and gleaming white.  Rumor seems like a loud, bright, and exciting place.  Reminds me of Miami or something, and I'm sure people love that kind of environment.  It's just not quite my cup of tea.",neutral

"Growing up in Arizona, the Buttes were always known to me as an awesome place to stay, although I never did because, well, I lived there. But as an adult coming back to the valley to visit, this place left me wanting more. Don't get me wrong, the grounds are awesome, the bartenders and staff are great and the breakfast is delicious, but the rooms really need a total revamp. Our room was large, and you could tell they had recently updated them, but an update isn't enough. Our shower knob just turned and turned so it was a guessing game as to when it would turn on or off, as well as what the temp would be, there was a solid inch gap where the faucet had pulled from the wall and someone tried to caulk it, but it was hideous and didn't work, our room still had a hideaway bed in the wall, very creepy!  The decor has got to go. Other than the outdated rooms and the millions of bees swimming next to you in the pools, this was a fun place to stay. They had live bands or Djs on the weekends by the pool, it was very lively, there are a few hidden hot tubs placed high in the mountain sides, overlooking the rest of the pool, and they had many great areas to get an awesome view of the beautiful Arizona sunsets.",neutral

So I didn't get to experience the sandwich line, which wasn't a bad thing as it was almost out the door when we arrived around 11:40 in the morning?!?!?!  I had never been here before, so I followed the lead of my acquaintance as he seems to have been here several times.  There are 2 self serve kiosks for soup/salads, which had very small lines.  I ordered a salad with chicken...went over to my left to the counter where I was given a tray, empty white unbreakable plastic bowl and a small cup of cooked chicken.....though I've never been to prison...""convicted....no.......never convicted"" I think I may have had a little taste of what it was liked being herded around like sheep with my prison like tray, bowl and fellow eaters all walking around in a well formed process.  The salad bar is good...though basic...nothing very creative here.  We ate, caught up on our work over the years and headed out. The place itself sits on the second floor of the EPICENTER in the corner of College and 4th with lots of windows, so it is light and bright.  The food was fine...pricing wasn't anything special...total for lunch (with water) (was $9.26 with tax = Salad $6.99 + Chicken $1.49 + tax).

"So, after reading the Yelp reviews, I knew there were two menus...and apparently one only (the more authentic one?) gets offered to ""Asian-looking"" customers. So I wasn't surprised when partner and I were given the ""other"" menu when we walked in on a Saturday night. One thing I liked instantly about the place is that it's spacious, with enough distance between the tables, and is well-lit. The restaurant was pretty full when we came in, at about 7, but we were immediately given a place to sit. For appetizers, we got the fried wontons with mustard and hot sauce dips. I thought the wontons were a little too crispy, and I would have liked some more filling in them. The service was fast and efficient, and we got the appetizers within seven minutes of being seated. For the main course, I got the Happy Family and partner got the Cashew chicken. They came with a medium sized bowl full of steamed rice. I had picked a Szechwan place because I was in the mood for spicy food, but both the dishes lacked any fire. We actually ended up getting hot sauce to spice things up! I liked the Happy Family....the veggies, meats and sauce made me happy. The portions were good for the price, though we did manage to eat everything up! I would have liked it though, if they offered tea with their food, as a complimentary add-on. And every table should have the usual condiments...soy sauce, a variety of hot sauces....those were strangely missing here. Also, I think everyone, regardless of whether they are Asians or not,  should be given both the menus. Whether I want to eat stomach of pork in sauce or pig's feet, is a choice I would like to make!",neutral
"Stopped in Le Saint Tropez on a Sunday evening after seeing a movie, by myself, for a quick dinner. I had a Prix Fixe menu. Started with escargot which were very good. Had the pork scallopini which was tough, and the sauce really didn't do much for this. And finished with profiteroles with the ice cream for dessert. The dessert was ok, actually, the portion seemed a little large.  Its a nice place to sit outside, watch the busy street and the passers by (including a man who was trying to parallel park his car and managed to hold up three streetcars in the process) and relax.  If I'm looking for french food, I'll likely look around a few other places before coming back.",neutral
"Met up with some friends for sushi last Sat night, they picked this place because it was close to the club they were heading too.  Our sever was Nori, she was amazing, very helpful and friendly.  One of my friends ordered a round of Sake for us, the Sake was warm with a powerful kick! My friend also wanted to do a Sake Bomb , but Red Sushi does not serve them, but if you know how set one up, you will find they have everything you need, so some did some Sake Bombs too.  Now I don't know if this is normal or not, but a friend and I showed up a little late to dinner and we still had in our hand our solo cup of booze, and never once did they tell us we had to get rid of it, maybe it because we were buying booze too. Who knows, but hey its Vegas baby!  Now is this the best sushi I have had? No, but is this the worst sushi I have had, no way. To start with I ordered some edamame; it was perfectly steamed and salted.  Then I ordered some California rolls, and you have the choice of having it either as a hand roll (looks like a sushi ice cream cone) or rolls, I went with rolls , it was fresh and it was good, I also ordered a Poppin Rock Sushi Roll, it was spicy tuna, crabmeat & avocado, never for the life of me did I think it would have pink pop rocks on top of it, but damnit it did. It was a shock me too, I guess I should have figured it out with the name Poppin Rock right? But after I got over the oh wow part, it was tasty, the mix of the flavors worked.   And for everything I ordered it ran me 28 bucks, now I had read the reviews and everyone said it was crazy expensive, but 28 sounds about right for me, everything I ordered tasted good and was fresh.  Would I come back again, sure why not?  Would I go for the Poppin Rock again, well probably not haha.",neutral

"If you couldn't get in to crowded CafΓ© Mediterranean, you probably wound up at one of its sister locations; this one is located two buildings down. Similar atmospheres, similar food and drink menus, prices are about the same. Although, for the summer, La Brava offers sheesha (shisha? It's not an English word, so spelling varies) for $9.95, but expect to spend a minimum of around $15, since you can't sit down without ordering a drink (water doesn't count), and drinks start at $4.50.   It's not bad, even though the waitress struck an attitude when we wanted to sit in one of the corner seats, rather than the crowded middle section she was trying to jam us in to. She dropped it when we told her we were going to be joined by a couple. Service here is slow, despite getting served by 3 different people; don't expect to get refills (paid or otherwise), and fully expect to ask for your glass of water 2x.   Sheesha flavors vary, I usually opt for the mango or berry flavors, but they were out of pomegranate for the night and the coconut sounded good. I wasn't disappointed. There's no alcohol here, but you can get either tea, juice or a virgin cocktail. What I do appreciate about the service is that they don't rush you out the door, so you can sit and relax with friends and talk in to the wee hours without someone side-eyeing you for copping your squat and only ordering one drink.  Hey, I would've ordered another if I had been asked by the server. :)",neutral
"This is my 3rd time here and either I was really drunk from the unlimited alcohol the last 2 times that I didn't remember all the bad qualities or that the selection has gone down hill. I'm not saying it was terrible, it's definitely better quality than most of the strip but not as good as I remember a couple of years ago.   Right now they have their holiday pricing for lunch which is $45 which is like double the normal price. $60 for unlimited Bloody Mary, Mimosas, Champagne, and Beer. I decided to opt out this time. The wait wasn't long (30 minutes at most) due to it being slow season. Now for the selection, they have a breakfast, meats, Asian, and desserts section. I was really disappointed because I didn't understand what justified the holiday pricing. No ham, turkey, festive food or anything. Plus there was barely any seafood. I was expecting crab legs, cocktail shrimp, oysters, etc. They only had cooked mussels (tiny and cold), cooked shrimp in an Asian sauce, 3 sushi rolls (nothing great).

"I had the creepiest dining experience I have had in a long time here the other night. I had been once before (I can't believe I didn't review...) for the lunch buffet about a year or two ago and it was really good... there was a wide variety of food and all was tasty....anyway, flash forward to last week, I went for dinner with a friend. We were one of two parties there and it was eerily quiet. Our waitress was a bit odd, but nice enough... the food was expensive and they were trying to push drinks and appetizers and whatnot....I felt like they were a bit disappointed when we just shared one entree and some naan. We got the chicken tikka masala, and it was good, but not as good as I had remembered it from the buffet. About half way through the meal, we were the only people in the restaurant (at like 6:45), and it felt like the employees were all staring at us...they had nothing else to do, it was just an odd feeling. I would consider going back for the lunch buffet, but don't think I would eat there for dinner again.",neutral

As one of my co-workers stated, it was just plain spicy but the flavors or lack there of leave much to be desired.

"Great night out with friends, designated driver assigned and everyone wants the party to continue. A friend recommended CR based on a coworkers visit so why not they have cocktails.  It was still pretty early apparently maybe 3pm so it wasn't super busy but maybe a table of people. The bartender appeared to be a tad lazy, was constantly on his phone and asked if we could return our glasses to the bar when done. I already felt a bit turned off and I just ordered my drink. We decided to order drinks off their men, I mean they have artisan drinks why the heck not a few herbs can only enhance the experience. Our drinks were very weak and couldn't taste the liquor period. We asked for it to be remade and came out in my mind worse. Ended up just drinking a beer and the experience was the same with the other 7 friends.   The bartender also talked a lot about cars when I went to return my glass and order another beer. He didn't leave his spot once but the guy was nice lol.  Overall, maybe it was just the bartender or a newbie since it was a Saturday around 3pm so not the busy time. We'll CR another try bc we've heard good things about the joint so update review to follow after next visit.",neutral

She told me there was a surcharge, which I saw on the menu there would be, but I couldn't figure out what the dish would have looked like WITHOUT the bonus shrimp!  And by Thai standards, the eggplant with shrimp dish was just ... bland!  Here's something tragically funny: On the window facing the parking lot, the large letters proclaim ""THAI FOOD AT BEST"".

Great course and very inexpensive. It is located right next to the phx zoo in the heart of the Papago mountains with $10-15 summer rates.   However.

"I'm writing this review whilst I sit at the desk of our junior suite on the 30th floor. It's coming up on midnight, and me and the gf just got out of the jetted tub where we'd been soaking in a hot bubble bath for almost two hours. Late-night munchies have hit us so we're thinking about ordering some room service. I see Southern fried-chicken and mash potatoes w/ gravy is available all night, yum. It's our last night here, so we're kinda desperate to make the most of what's left of our 4 night stay. President Obama is due to arrive in town around the time we'll be heading to the airport, so I asked the concierge to send our complimentary limo (a perk if you take advantage of the Prima Privilege Program) an hour earlier than originally planned. Would be nice to hang around to maybe catch a glimpse of the POTUS, but oh well.   It was a nice little vacation here at the Signature, although not a flawless experience. Our room greeted us with a slightly unpleasant odor (like someone got sick in the room some time ago) that was annoying enough for me to call housekeeping to bring a can of deodorizing spray. Help didn't come until after a third call to the front desk to explain the situation. Maybe because it was the 4th of July that they were slow to respond, but this kind of delay at such a highly-rated hotel makes for a somewhat disappointing experience. It must be noted that some minor trash was found under our bed, as well as a moist spot on the rug. Disconcerting stuff to say the least.  Well, after the initial bad feelings, I have to say that the staff at the Signature made the rest of our stay pleasant and comfortable. For example, we slept in on a couple days, preventing housekeeping from making their rounds. But a call to the concierge is all it took to get our room fully serviced while we were away at night. And the housekeeping staff is very transparent here, no apparent noise in the hallways early in the morning or even a sighting of a maid or cleaning cart. I don't know how they did it, but I am impressed.   The amount of walking required when staying at the Signature is considerable if you don't like to walk or are unable to be very mobile on foot. One good thing about staying at the Signature is that you're relatively close to the monorail that runs the length of the Strip - very convenient. If you're considering trying the Prima Card, make sure to ask the concierge to explain the program benefits in detail. We got the impression that some of the vendors associated with the program were not at all familiar with how it operates, and found ourselves having to explain the program more than a couple of times. Depending on how important the benefits and perks are to you, you may or may not be willing to front the $500 that the Prima Program requires.  I'm giving the Signature 3 stars, but it's really more like 3 and a half. Can't go as far as giving it a 4 because of the initial room issues and because the hotel is located just far enough away from the Strip to keep it from being ideally situated. Also, the pool was too crowded to go swimming in comfortably, while an adjacent pool intended for weekend use only remained vacant. But go ahead and give Signature a try - you might have better luck and have a 4 or 5 star experience. And if you find a good price online, it should definitely be one of the better deals in town.",neutral
"Basha's proximity to Mcgill is definitely an asset. They offer fairly large portions at decent prices.   I had the chicken plate which had pretty sizable servings of potatoes, rice, chicken, and salad. I had to take some home, and I'm a pretty big guy.   My main complaint was that the chicken was dry - really dry. I'm not sure if it had something to do with having an early lunch and maybe getting some edges of the chicken, but it really held back the meal quality.   I wasn't the most impressed, especially with other really good Lebanese restaurants not too far away. But, if you're in a hurry, hungry, and craving Lebanese food, Basha might have something for you.    Be aware they only take cash or debit.",neutral

"*3.5 stars*  To the point:  Good food & atmosphere but slow and sometimes hard to get service.   This place opened a bit before I left Toronto so I was excited to finally check it out (I missed those Yelp events...*sad*).  Anyway, I came by here for dinner with a few friends on a weeknight.  It was quiet and never more than a quarter full of diners.   The ambiance is typical downtown-exposed brick (which I really like) and dim lit dining.  Our first server was hard to get a hold of - we had to wait about 15 minutes and then occasionally waving our hand to try to get his attention before we were able to put in our order.  It looked as though he was too busy at the bar chatting.   Service was like that right up to when we tried to flag him down for the bill.  Oh well, at least it gave me ample time to catch up with my friends.  So onward to the food: Deep Fried Calamari (off the tapas menu) - it came with a roasted pepper aioli which was good but tasted a bit on the generic side.  The batter they used for the calamari wasn't very good or maybe they just didn't fry it long enough as the batter was a bit on the soft/non-crispy side.  I would pass on this next time.   Fusili Pasta - sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms and sauteed beef in garlic balsamic oil.  This was pretty good and it had a different spin on pasta since it's not the standard tomato or cream sauce.  There was just enough balsamic oil to coat the pasta so it wasn't dry and the beef was tender.  I liked it.   Overall, it was good but I docked half a star for the lackluster service.",neutral
"2.5 Stars for Food Visited Smash Kitchen in August during late lunch hours for a quick meal.  The restaurant is very spacious and has lots of nice circular seating booths.    Ordered the Smash Burger, Baby Back Ribs and Neptune pizza.  The burger tasted ok but the ribs were a bit too dry and the meat is lacking favor.  The pizza was the best among all.  However,  it would be nice if the toppings are more generous.    With an average price tag of $20+ per item, I was a bit disappointed and would expected better food quality from Smash Kitchen.",neutral
"Came here for lunch and it wasn't too busy. Service wasn't anything outstanding but the usual ""take your order, bring your order then your bill"". This location particularly has more students during the weekdays due to the school right across the road from them.

With that said, the quality of the rolls and sushi have declined over the years with fish being not so fresh and the rice will be warm.

"I've been wanting to try this place out for awhile now and finally decided to just make the trip here and try it out. I had such great hopes for this place, but it just didn't really hit home for me. I got here around 12:30 on a Sunday and there weren't that many people so that for me was not a good sign. This place should've been packed.   The hostess sat us quickly, but sat us in the very back at a booth that was big enough for a family of 8 or 10 people!! Felt weird to be at such a large table when there were plenty of tables that were much smaller and a better fit for a party of just two people.   Our waitress came by quickly and took our drink order. Our drinks came out very quickly. Since this was the first time we came here, our waitress gave us some time to look over the menu. About 15 minutes later she came back and took our order. We decided to try the Chicago 7 deep dish individual size which was $12.95. We have never had a deep dish pizza before so decided on a smaller size so not to waste if we didn't like it. Along with the pizza, we decided to share a half size Crispy buffalo chicken salad which cost $8.99.  Food took about 20 minutes to come out. The pizza was smaller than expected but more than we could finish. Not sure if it was just the toppings/type of pizza I got, but I wasn't all that thrilled about it. The pizza was bland, not much cheese, it was really watery so the crust was soggy and there were so many tomatoes on the top that I couldn't really even taste any of the other toppings. Not sure if this is how deep dish pizzas are supposed to be, but it was just not my cup of tea. Probably will never order this type of pizza again. On a better note, the salad was huge!! They kindly divided the half order between two plates before they brought them out to us so I thought that our waitress had misunderstood me and ordered us two half sizes. She told me that their salad sizes are very large. So glad I decided to only order a half size. The chicken was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of buffalo sauce on them. The lettuce was fresh and they gave us just the right amount of ranch dressing. The salad was delicious and made up for my dislike of the pizza.   Wish I could remember our waitress's name as she was super friendly and very informative. She had a great attitude and seemed happy to be helping her customers. She always had a smile on her face.   Wouldn't recommend this place for an intimate date as it was loud. Even though there weren't that many people there, it seemed so loud that I really couldn't hear myself think. Didn't help that the people in the booth beside us were talking loud and making a scene.",neutral

"First place on my tour of Cleveland, thanks to my buddy Patrick.  This was my first Pho experience, and it was-as the three-star rating might suggest- A-OK.  All of us got a combo meal, which included a Vietnamese sandwich, and all but one of us got the Pho.  I chose the flank steak.  It had an interesting appearance, looked and tasted a little bit stringy.  Everything else about the soup was ok, and I like that they include a bunch of stuff on the side that you can add the way you like, such as sweet basil, bean sprouts, and some extra hot jalapeΓ±os.  Add in some sriracha hot sauce, and the soup was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy.  The jasmine hot tea was a good choice to complement the meal.  And for the amount of money ($10 or so), you get a ton of food.  Cons:  If you're white or inexperienced in Pho like myself, there's not a whole lot of explanation of the different kinds of food.  Also, there's an extra charge for to-go containers.  Not a huge deal, as the containers are pretty heavy-duty, but it's not something you see everyday.  Overall, it was a good meal with good friends.  If I make it back to Cleve, it's on the list!",neutral

It was over an hour for hummus, salad, and crackers!  We ended up returning it because we were moving to our services. We were told that we would have to pay for food separately. Meaning, I would have to leave my relaxation to get my payment out of my locker, really?   Overall, good experience.

"Finally got to try this new ayce sushi restaurant. I had to call one week in advance to reserve a table. Tonight I had reserved a table at 7pm. My friends and I arrived on time but we still had to wait about 15mins to be seated. Line up was crazy as usual, tons of people packed in the front door. Inside decor is pretty nice and cozy. The seats against the walls have pillows which adds a nice touch.   We had heard and read reviews that the torched and pressed sushi is really good. But to me it was just alright. The torched beef sushi and maki rolls were pretty good though. Also the pork belly and lamb skewers were yummy. Sashimi was fresh and good. They have a large selection of items and some that other ayce restaurants don't have. I would say the food is decent though, not that great. Zucchini tempura was way too soggy. Seaweed salad too dry. Spicy salmon sushi was meh. And they put too much sauce on their special maki rolls. The other cooked foods were ok, just like any other ayce restaurant.   I really enjoyed the desserts here. They have a big selection and unique items but I was too full to try them all. My favorite is the mango slush, vanilla creme brulee and the cheesecake. Kinda sad they didn't have chocolate ice cream and the red bean ice cream wasn't even available.  Service was surprisingly very good other than being seated 15mins late for a reserved table. Food came out pretty quick and didn't miss any items. Our waiter was super nice and made sure we were ok and got all our items. We got to stay 2.5 hours as there was another reservation after us.   Would I come back again? Maybe. But definitely not my first choice especially since I had to book one week ahead.",neutral

Cons  Miso Sesame Roll: The miso sesame dressing was a major fail since there was no taste of miso or sesame in the dressing.

"Great food and nice setting.  From the moment we walked in, the service was  not great. Took almost 10 minutes for a hostess to come address us and find us a seat. Nobody in front of us and we just stood at the front of a restaurant that wasn't even  at 25% capacity.  Service was marginal at best.  Waitress displayed very little effort with checking on us, refilling drinks, etc.  Not sure if we will be back.",neutral

"Inexpensive, large portions, and decent-to-good food.  I've been here four times now, and we've had some inconsistencies from one visit to another.  The food has always been at least decent, but often quite good, the portions are almost always large, and I'm usually surprised by how little we've paid at the end.  We've had the Peking Duck here three times, and the first time it was pretty nice, the subsequent time our first course was mostly skin, and the third time was somewhere in between.  I certainly wouldn't suggest that you consider this the best Peking Duck in the city, or even within a half-hours drive, but it's here, it's decent, and it's not terribly expensive.  We've had three different congees here, and the House Super Bowl and the Fresh Scallop congees were both quite good, where the Lobster Super Bowl Congee was a disappointment.  We've also had the mixed meat chow mein twice, and I have to admit I have a soft spot for stir fried noodles that are cooked hard like these.  The 'assorted meat' includes a fair number of organ meats, so if that's not your thing, I'd pick something different.  Is it exceptional?  No.  But it's reasonably good and reasonably priced.",neutral

"3.5 stars.  This is a really cute cafe that opened up a few months ago on finch. And when I kept seeing pictures of their matcha drink with macarons on IG, I really wanted to try.  Because the seating are limited (four small round tables and one long table), it may be hard to find a seat. I noticed a group of ε―δΊδ»£ (2nd gen rich mainland) taking up the table beside them to put their stupid designer bags! Like are you kidding me? What happens when there are customers coming who want a seat? My friend and I sat at the first table by the door. And because the Hello Gorgeous sign was in front of us, these group of girls were legit taking up our space to snap a thousand pics which made us feel uncomfortable because they were all up on us! So eventually we had to move. So annoying.   Anyway, the drink itself I will tell you now it's okay. It's basically an ice matcha topped off with cream and macarons. But for 7.50(?) I'd rather order another drink next time.",neutral

(to be honest...i didn't want a burger so late in the evening).  i thought it was odd that the ladies bathroom had only one toilet and a sink...it made for lots of waiting.    on the positive: the 10 dollar entry included a goody bag and in my lovely goody bag:  8 oz grace foaming and shower cream! astara skincare samples, coupon for massage from space, 20 percent off urban seven for lunch or dinner, and a wine stopper.  1 martini and 1 house wine also part of that 10 dollar entry fee.  the martini was average in my opinion. i can make a better martini at home.   i digged the restaurant side much better than the bar. they had some cool drums playing and our server anthony was great. he made sure we had everything we needed. he was attentive and personable.  so i would probably return to the restaurant and give them a second try with my 20 percent coupon. i enjoyed the cool vibe.",neutral

Bartender was nice and giving the bar a serious wipe down which I always like to see :) Service for takeout was quick and friendly - they offered us a drink while we waited. They didn't give us any bbq sauce in our takeout bag which was a bummer, but nothing really needed it for our tastes - still I'm sure that would bother some people. Ok, so the food... meh? the chicken wings were the best thing we ordered. They were spicy (not buffalo) and smoked...REALLY good. The brisket... blech! sliced in thick, long blocks, versus thin strips and VERY dry. Worst brisket I've ever had. Not a fan of their coleslaw... bland. We got baby back and St. Louis style ribs as well. Both were good, but nothing memorable. The mac n cheese was super yummy!

It's a good $9-$12 for a meal. Granted, if you actually put vegetables on your sandwich (I put literally everything they offer on mine) you won't need to eat for the rest of the day, but I still. Not cheap for students.   I've had the gyro (good) and the Dagwood (meh.) I'd stick with the gyro meat. I love that they have a bevy of spreads and sauces, but again, they definitely charge you for it.   The place is clean, but I've also noticed how employees switch between jobs without changing gloves - which defeats the purpose of the gloves.

I was disappointed with the fries though, but the sweet potato fries my friend got was fried very nicely. I also got the cookies and cream milkshake, and found it ok. Not worth 4+ dollars in my opinion. I also tried my friend's nutella peanut milkshake and found it waaayy too thick and heavy, so not really worth the hype in the milkshake department. Although the burger was good, it wasn't exceptional enough for me to be like, ""wow, I must take my friends here.""

The matcha flavour is very rich and strong, and the tiramisu itself was so creamy. Loved it.  The sakura cheesecake was very interesting. There is a layer of jelly at the top with some sakura petals embedded in it for a beautiful aesthetic. It has a very light floral flavour, and very lovely.

Mediocre food with no ambiance at all.  I decided on this place because I ran into a groupon and I still haven't learned my lesson  that sometimes there's a good reason to skip on a groupon deal because the food isn't great. The food here was ok. No bold flavors and it's not a spot I would likely visit again.   Mexican places should always have some authentic decor and the ambiance is key for me because the experience begin with your eyes. There's nothing of that nature here and the food pretty much went along with everything else. I ordered a hard chicken taco & a cheese enchilada which lacked in flavor and my mans mega burrito was a mega disappointment as well. Lots of food for sure but not traditional in any way.   The service was good so thank you for that but it needs some traditional decorations and a chef who knows about Mexican flavors.

Firestone is literally up the street; we had the car towed there, and the opening hours were definitely a huge plus. 7 am is perfect if you need to drop off your car before work. The prices, in my opinion, are inflated, as are most of these chain auto places-and they always suggest a million other things that your car should get, but that you don't necessarily need. They were there for me in a pinch and I am grateful! We had only the necessary repairs done, without being pushed for anything further. As another reviewer posted, the promised times are way off. It took quite a few calls and an entire day to finally get my car done. I've had tires and oil changes done here too, and they are always courteous.

"If you're in the mood for Chinese take out and don't want that corporate Panda express crap, you're in the right place. This joint cooks their food to order, albeit quickly, instead of leaving their food out under nausea inducing heat lamps. I definitely like that it is family owned and fairly priced.    You can taste the freshness in the food that you won't find at one of those stereotypical chinese fast food eateries. The portion sizes were generous too and a family meal is more than enough food for a family of 5, or perhaps even 6. That being said, the taste was only decent. The fried rice was flavorful and rich. The egg drop soup was as expected. The orange chicken is tasty and familiar, but brings nothing new to the table. The kung pao chicken had lots of crunchy vegetables but I have had better. The crab rangoons weren't good at all, but don't take my word for it because I've never liked those things. The spring rolls were ok but I've had better at random hole in the wall thai restaurants. The bottom line is that this place, while worthy of my future business, still cannot beat Pick up Stix in terms of quality and flavor.

"I am torn between three and four stars.  I want to give them six stars for the superb food, but the service is extremely lacking.    My husband and I have been to Tako twice.  The first time was an utter disaster with our appetizer forgotten, and ordered more takos to make up for it at the end.  My husband and our table were sprayed with water coming from the soda gun at the bar.  Our waiter was only concerned about the cute girls beside us.  We were practically ignored. The manager finally came over when we said don't bring us more takos just let us leave.  The manager was completely appropriate and gave us our meal with tacos to go.  It was quiet a while before we tried it again.  It wasn't as bad as the first visit, but still sub-par service. The second round, after being there for thirty minutes I couldn't get my waitress's attention to ask for more water.  She did not make eye contact with me.  Even when I am walking in and out of the restaurant, the staff does not even stop to let me through as they must be more important than I am.  I just do not understand this mentality.   However..... the tacos are so freaking good.  The Tako taco is so delicious with the most perfectly cooked octopus I have ever eaten (not chewy, which is so hard to do)! The octopus is complemented with delicious lemon vinegarette and crispy chickpeas, OMG!!! Cannot get enough.  The other tacos we had were also delicious including lamb barbacoa and duck.  So good!! Plus the guacamole: chorizo and goat cheese.  We almost licked the bowl.     YUM YUM YUM!  But I will probably get take-out takos from here on out.

"This is good value, basic Thai food, mildly authentic, served at cheap prices.  The FOOD:  The spring rolls are super tasty and super addictive.  Just trust your instincts: if they feel hot when you pick them up, they will burn your tongue when you eat them ;)  The basil pad thai is a nice twist on things.  Their curries are good, but not terribly authentic.  These flavors are being cooked by Chinese people for white folk, so don't expect the full Thai experience.  The SERVICE: Rather inconsistent.  It seems to alternate between one waiter who's really on top of things and another waiter that just stares into space instead of noticing that your water has been empty for 15 minutes.  Be prepared to flag staff down when you want something...don't be shy.    This is basic Thai food served at basic prices.

I really used to like this place.  Dark dive bar that served food late night and was always cool on a hot Phoenix night.  It still is all of that but the food has gone down hill and there are other options in Downtown Phoenix that serve good Irish Pub food and / or are open late night.  Bar - 4 stars.  Great bartenders that pour stiff drinks and are generally on top of things.  The place does get a little crowded and the bar is a little long.  If there is only one bartender behind the bar he or she can miss you if you are on the other end.  5 - star scotch / whiskey selection.  Food - 3 stars.  I used to really like the Rueben and the Chicken Pot Pie.  Unfortunately both have declined.  They don't grill the rye bread in butter anymore I think they just toast it. The Chicken Pot pie crust is not good.  The fish and chips are good and the fish sandwich is good too.  I still come here for the drinks and the cool dive bar air conditioning but the food used to be a lot better.,neutral

"Service is great. Delivery is fast.  Delivery kids are nice. They charge a $1.00 for delivery, so that comes off their tip.  12 wings are $12.00.  They just started posting their prices online and I understand why. They are very expensive.  Been there since 2012 and just put their prices out there.  Pasquales has 20 wings for $15.99 and 10 wings for $7.99.  They are just as good.  I was very disappointed tonight. I got wings. They were crunchy because they were reheated in the microwave then covered in sauce and the zuchhini (cold) was supposed to be batter dipped like tempura, but seemed breaded.  In addition, there was no taste to them at all.  I probably wont order from them again as they smidge on the pizza sauce too.   Too bad though cuz they are so close.",neutral

"I normally like Italian foods and restaurants, but I don't think I'll likely come back to this place again.   To begin, they don't really have any individual menus for you to view. Instead, they have a giant menu placed on the wall for EVERYONE to view. It was quite hard to see what was on it, especially when your table is far away.   Regarding the food, it is quite good. The servings come VERY large so it's acceptable to have at least a group of people when you come here.",neutral

This location is fast and friendly, but there's no wifi -- and it cost them a whole star from me.  Applebee's is the same price and quality, so why do they offer free wifi and Chili's won't?

"After seeing the video of the jiggly bread from Japan, I was curious if this place was the same as the hype from Japan so my friends and I decided to stop by and check it out. After being open for about a year already, I guess the hype for this place has died down because there was no line when we arrived on a Friday afternoon. We just got 1 cheesecake for $10.  Note: there are two stores that are next to each other, this one only sells the regular flavor cheesecake while next door offers the green tea/matcha flavored baked goods. Choose wisely before you go to the respective store to order your food.  Like all the other posts, this description of this Japanese style cheesecake is pretty accurate by saying that is soft, fluffy, and eggy. From the look of it, you would not imagine how soft it is until you touch it or actually eat it. But in my opinion, it is way too eggy so if you do not like the eggy taste, then avoid!  It was a good experience to try but I do not think I would get it again, especially if there is a long line for it..",neutral

"Ambiance: Upscale and trendy spot in the the Yard. The sparse decor with minimalist stylings along with the white tile walls gives the place a sterile vibe. Patrons are typically 30 and above and a little less rowdy than those visiting the other establishments in the Yard.  Food/Service: The three varieties of oysters we tried were good however I can't comment on which ones we especially liked as the server-help couldn't remember which ones were which...very disappointing and I expected a little better service when dropping that much money on food.  The Maine lobster roll was delicious but portions were rather small. The warm jar of crab was also awesome.  Price: On the high end, reasonable for quality but unreasonable for portions.  Overall: Could be a four star establishment as the food was great but with the less than stellar service and small portions gotta go three stars. The place is still a great option for quality seafood. Probably still in my top three.",neutral

Main course:  shared the scallops & the meat lasagna.  Between the two, the lasagna was better....it was cooked well (not overly soggy) & the amount of cheese was perfect...not too much.

"Re-review after ownership change - honestly the food hasn't changed much, so it's still a tough place to review because of hit-or-miss dishes and service. Probably a 3.5* and maybe a bit harsh rounding down, but I just can't justify rounding up given the negatives.  Thai Thai does get the basics right; generally, the flavors are authentic Thai and they handle the spiciness well if you so request (you have to ask for super spicy - i.e., off the charts - if you want authentic levels of spiciness).  And frankly, some of the dishes are amazing. Their crab meat fried rice is one of the best fried rice dishes I've had anywhere, and I do love my fried rice. I also love their roast duck curry, wonton soup, tamarind duck, and basil anything. I also usually round off the ordering with a green curry or panang dish, both of which I find satisfactory.  So unfortunately, the bad:   The fish quality here is just really suspect. For example, there's been twice now that we've gotten the salmon panang and it was just obviously not good or fresh salmon - the texture and flavor were just so off. Even when it's more edible, it's still not great fish.  Also, service is usually friendly but it can be very slow especially if there are lots of tables seated. I have waited 30+ mins at lunch even when it's not that full so may not be the best choice if you have a limited lunch break.  All in all, this place will satisfy my Thai fix as long as I stick to the stuff they do well - and I'm pretty glad to have it around if only because there aren't many other Thai options on this side of town.",neutral

"Let me start by saying I love Tapas restaurants. And Spanish tapas are my favorite. This restaurant has a nice decor. The theme of the tapas are more Mediterranean to eastern European than spanish. The tapas were either hit or miss.  We had four dishes picked out. Two of which we were informed were not available. The replacement choices were not that great. The first dish we tried the hummus con Carne was excellent. The last a seared peppers was just plain weird. But the sauce was nice. I probably won't be back, by t it was nice to try. Also the dessert menu was not impressive. The service started out great but by the time we were ready to leave the servers had vanished.",neutral

I though that was weird because I could have sworn the sign said the sandwiches came with a side salad or veggies. My boyfriend ordered the cesar salad,  The sandwich was good, lots of bacon and a good size. The chips and salsa were cheap like cafeteria level. Cheap salsa I am pretty sure was Pace.  Bf's salad: Mediocre at best but still edible.  The place needs a little extra attention in its interior and menu ingredients. I would love to have a good cafe close to my house.",neutral

"With the number of gas all trying to get gas at the same time, you would have thought this was the only gas station for miles.

Can someone finished pumping gas even maneuver through that cars waiting to even get out? Will I found a spot so I can pull in on the side with my tank? Will I be force to back up because the person in front of my and facing me because their tank is on the opposite side? Will the pump I pull up to even work?  (One pump was out of order).  Honestly, it was a pain to get in to this place to get gas.  Luckily for me, I pulled into the lane where there was a broken pump with an out of order sign so I know nobody would pull in front of me so I was able to get out without much issue.   Once there, everything was fine.  Remember it's AMPM so if you want to use an ATM, there's a surcharge.

"I've wanted to try this place for breakfast since I saw it on Man V Food but somehow it took me years to finally get here.

The menu is intimidating with loads of interesting choices but it almost seems as if you can't go wrong. Everything looked impressive as it was served to other tables. It took me quite some time to decide what I wanted to eat as everything sounded great but I wasn't disappointed with my choice. The only downfall is it's a bit pricey for breakfast but it is semi touristy and you do get A LOT of food. I felt more full than I normally do walking out of a breakfast buffet.

However, the service left a lot to be desired.... so much so that even the table next to us were complaining. We came into an empty restaurant to a confused hostess who did not know where to seat us.  Once we were seated, we ordered our meals. When the same two appetizers came (dips and sauces), we had one piece of bread for the two appetizers. Every other table had two breads for two appetizers. We kindly asked the waitress... three times in the span of 30 minutes. No acknowledgement. It should not be that difficult to get a piece of bread. Waitress could not care less about our table. While taking our order she spoke over us to the table across, which was pretty rude.  Food took a while to come out, and the general consensus was that there were too few waiters/waitresses for the amount of people.",neutral

I lived here for 6 months.  Had a difficult roommate situation and give 5 stars to management for helping us out.  There were multiple issues of car break-ins and towing so you definitely need to know the rules.  The lot fills up fast and it would be helpful to buy the street pass for $30 a year so you're not up a creek if you get home past 9 pm. The apartments are older so you get what you pay for in that sense.  They've done renovations in the kitchen and the 2 bedroom floor plan is a decent layout but I saw a cockroach in my closet and things just broke a little quicker than I would've liked so I felt like we called maintenance every 2 weeks.

Ok their smoked meat is very very good.   Hand cut, and nothing wrong with it.  This place loses 2 stars because honestly its just stupid to wait hours for a table.  I would barely wait 2 hours in line if I needed a kidney transplant let alone to sit down and eat a sandwich.  Just go to the takeout area.  Their Karnatzel is the best i've ever had.  Get it dry.  The taste of the meat stick in your mouth is amazing and makes you just want to be a meat stick prostitute. Why doesn't yelp have half stars.  This is another key example were a half star is needed.  Its a 3.5.  Has anyone Yelped Yelp?  For the record I give yelp a 3 until they change and offer half stars.",neutral
"I went here after waiting for a long errand. If you're going to go here I would not suggest the regular burger. It felt overpriced and too greasy for an ordinary cheeseburger especially in Vegas. For cheaper you can get a better version of this cheeseburger at In N Out and everything tastes less greasy and more fresh.   I'm not a fan of bacon burgers but the bacon burger my boyfriend got was way bigger and tastier than my burger and about the same price. The biggest strength of the entire bacon burger was the barbecue sauce. Definitely the right thickness and taste. Would highly recommend this if you come for a burger, as it beats Carl's Jr's western bacon burgers out of the water, as well as most other bbq bacon burgers I've recalled having.  Otherwise it was standard fair for fast food. On par with other fast food services.  The mozzarella sticks are fine too. They're on par with most mozzarella sticks from other places. The winner here is the fries. The fries are amazing.  I'm not sure if they were fried in animal fat but the oil they used definitely had some flavor to it. It's not as great as I would have hoped but I suspect my review would've been higher if I based it on the bacon burger I had and not my cheeseburger",neutral

I ordered a pita gyro, Athens fries, falafel as an appetizer, coffee, and  baklava for dessert.   The good: Athens fries. Fresh hot and excellent seasoning.  Coffee. Very hot and smooth. Falafel. Two people in my party had never tried falafel, but really liked Paymon's take. Excellent.  The bad: The gyro. This was my main course and the worst part of my meal. The meat was heaping, but was cold and unappetizing. It must have been sitting a very long time before being served. I came here for a good gyro and was unhappy with the fare.  Do yourself a favor and drive a block away to Stephano's across the street from UNLV. The gyros at Stephano's are superior.",neutral

The staff was great! But the lanes need some serious TLC. When you're paying per hour, it's frustrating to continually loose time waiting for the lanes to get fixed. Again, great staff!

"During this visit, I only tried a few things so I'm open to coming again to try other dishes and add to my review later on.  They have a huge selection so lots to choose from.    Food: Ordered 3 things: Oyster slider burgers, lobster roll and soft shell crab seafood fried rice.  We liked the oyster slider burgers the best in terms of texture and taste.  It was unique and we enjoyed it.  The lobster roll was also very fresh and delicious.  However, the lobster roll was pretty small and it came with sides that were nothing special.  The soft soft shell crab seafood rice was a good idea and we could taste the crunchy bits of sot shell crab but other than that, it was just normal fried rice.  It was okay but no wow factor.  Perhaps, we didn't choose the right dishes.  Maybe next time, I'll try the other side of the menu to try their seafood ""boil"" options.    Service:  Great atmosphere, spacious and comfortable seating. Great for coming with a group of friends to sample more dishes and also to just hang out or watch a games from their many TVs.  Service was prompt and attentive.",neutral

I appreciated the fact that he showed me the used one because I am still very new to gold and do not want to spend a fortune on nicer clubs, but I also am past beginner sets.  The problem I have with this place is that there were signs stating the clothing was buy one, get another 50% off.  I picked up a few items and went to pay, but the cashier told me that the sale only applied to a few brands, not the brand I selected.  I did not argue because I had shopped on Amazon and new that even with the sale price I thought I was getting, Amazon was a little cheaper, I would just have to wait for delivery.  She said that the signs and the system were not always in sync.  This place is great if you know what you want, just do your shopping first and make sure you are comfortable with the price.",neutral

"My favourite thing about this Sushi chain restaurant is their selection of unique rolls. THey don't do the typical combo platters that most Sushi places feature, but have a very extensive list of rolls that have yet to let me down. Who knew Tuna, Salmon, and Avocado could make so many different dishes.  My measuring stick for a good sushi joint is always in the sashimi, and this place meets the mark. I've always really enjoyed it here and so that means everything else is decent.  They don't have the best hours, only open for lunch and then dinner, nothing in between, which I think is unfortunate.   The decor is pretty plain, run of the mill. Nothing fancy here at all.  The one thing I don't like is how close your'e sitting to the people next to you. They are honestly part of your conversation. Not my style!  For convenient yummy sushi, this place usually wins my vote.",neutral
"The decor is so cute in here.  I've tried the avocado toast, the pear and goat cheese and the PB honey one.  The bread that they use is super soft and dense and overall I like the toast here. My only suggestion is that they should used a poached egg rather than hard boiled and it should be included in to the price.  One thing I really don't like is their smoothie prices. $9 for a small maybe 12-16 ounce smoothie is ridiculous. That's something I'd expect in the cosmo but not in the suburbs.  It's easy to feel kind of ripped off here. I'd come here every once in a while if I'm really craving it but overall just an average experience.  Btw you can make any of theses toasts EASILY at home, it's just a matter of if you're willing to pay for convenience or not.",neutral

"This place was better than a lot of the reviews on here say. Especially for the price during CES.  We are not party animals, and did not miss having a casino downstairs. We also did not miss the associated resort fee. We got upgraded to a huge 2-floor suite. It had a hot tub, it was clean and good.  Minor gripes:  We were missing the TV remotes but after a call one was delivered promptly. The hot tub only dispensed hot water and it was too hot; we had to walk and get ice. And the closest ice machine was broken. There was no fridge, and that room was enormous so they could have fit one. Housekeeping did enter our room, but all they did as far as we could tell is drain the hot tub.  The blankets were the kind you get at a gross cheap motel. This is a big issue for my man; minus one star for this. Get better blankets, people. Hotel rooms are designed for being in bed, and this should be obvious.   Not a perfect place, but a lot better than many places. Much more satisfying than other places we stayed in the area.",neutral

"Pros: Great games for kids and adults of all ages. There are only a few ""gun"" games and those are easily avoided if you have little ones (or big ones). For $25 the three of us played about 15 games which took us about 30 minutes. This was perfect amount of time for a 4 year old plus mom and dad looking forward to dinner after. The games seemed modern and felt pretty clean.  Cons: The smell (upstairs) of spilled beer made me feel as if I jumped back in time to the crappy bars of my early twenties. Bartender didn't seem knowledgable about the beers - I asked for a Laganitas and she didn't know what I was talking about, but the beer was on the menu. My husband went back and showed her that they do carry it.  We did not eat here - so I can't comment on the food. The downstairs bar smelled much better than upstairs. Will come back again!",neutral

Our food was out in a reasonable time. My husband enjoyed his choices. Unfortunately, my ribs were way over done and I was barely able to cut them. It took a little while before our server was back so that I could mention the issue. Once I mentioned it he was very apologetic and offered to have it remade which was nice. I decided against it. Shortly thereafter the manager came over and asked what the problem was and I explained to him as well. He was very courteous. In the end, they removed the food from the bill without hesitation. Overall our experience wasn't terrible here but the food was not stellar. If you are just going for drinks it is definitely a nice place with a nice atmosphere and good customer service. The three stars is strictly due to the food experience.",neutral

"Great service, nice atmosphere which will be even better in the summer when the overhead doors are open. We also enjoyed the food, although we were hoping for a fresher California feel. The menu is heavy on chicken, pork and bacon and there weren't too many vegetarian options. I was happy to see a few seafood dishes but they often had pork (shrimp tacos are my favorite but they had bacon lardon, so I passed). I finally settled on the Hawaiian truck style shrimp which was delicious, if small for the price ($16.50 for a medium bowl I easily finished). We'll be back, but hope there will be menu rotations occasionally with more vegetarian and seafood options.  Update: We tried Bear and Bottle again and the experience wasn't great. We stopped for a drink after a movie. It was about 9:30 or 10:00, and the host seemed slightly put out that we were coming in. This may be because the entrance is awkward, so the host has to leave the stand to greet you. There are two doors and the front one was partially blocked by carts and signs (but there were still plenty of people inside). The service was slow. We had to order at the bar while the table next to us had a server. I like the space and there are some good qualities, but sadly this place is falling a little flat for us.  Update: I was happy to see a bean burger added to the menu, but sadly it was disappointing. Way too thick and mealy. A bean burger is best when it's a little thinner so the beans retain some firmness and the edges crisp. The flavor was good but the texture was awful. And to add insult to injury, there was a $1.50 upcharge for it!   I had such high hopes for a California inspired restaurant. I was dreaming of simple fish or shrimp tacos, veggie dishes, limey drinks and fresh guacamole. We'll continue to support Bear and Bottle but will stick to drinks on the patio.",neutral

"The food was amazing, loved the vibe of the patio area, however we had to wait a ridiculously long time for our appetizer. We were a two top that was greeted at the same time as the five top beside us was being sat. We ordered our app (tuna tartar with flash fried rice) at the first greet. The table beside us got bar drinks and their entrees way before we got our appetizer. When it finally came out it was great, but our ramen came out while we were taking our first bites. We had an overcrowded table, ramen getting cold, and were just ready to leave at that point.  We basically just packed the ramen and went home. I totally understand that these things happen but nothing was offered to remedy the situation, server did not seem to pick up the fact that we weren't happy, no manager ever came by the table to see how things were going.  Overall service was just lacking.",neutral

"Tibet Kitchen. I want to give it a 4-stars, but simply cannot. Here's why:  1) Food: This is a tough one. It may be just Tibetan food, but the entrees we ordered oddly lacked flavor and spice. We ordered the shaptak and chicken chili, both promising a little heat, but it was lacking. It almost had no taste.  2) Service: They were friendly, but slooooooooow. It took awhile to get seated, to take our order, for our food to arrive, and for us to get the bill. The entire experience took around three hours.  Despite the above, the space is beautiful and spacious. They have a back outdoor patio that is perfect. When we went it was full, so it must be popular. Perhaps we're missing something.",neutral

"Met my daughter there for dinner. I couldn't believe how crowded the place was on a Thursday night. There were lots of TV's around showing college and pro basketball. Only one TV screen, that I saw, showed the PGA Tournament at Torrey Pines. Our server, Dana, was excellent. Always checking to see that our drink glasses were filled or checking to see if we need anything else. We started off with their chicken wings which were excellent. I had the BBQ Burger which I ordered medium rare with half and half. The burger was cooked well and the onion rings were limp and tasteless. The fries were also limp, must have been sitting in the basket waiting to be served up. It too was tasteless until I added salt. The bacon was chewy and NOT crisp. But, put food in front of me and I''ll just clean the plate. Price was right. My daughter picked up the tab.",neutral
"I'm going to start off with the saying that this place gets an extra star because it seems ""very Pittsburgh""  Food:Its not a place to go for a salad. I had a trout salad and though the trout was good the salad was really just a lettucey bed for it to hang out on.  The person I went with had some sort of amazing meat-happy sandwich that I drooled over the whole time I ate. This is what Kazansky's is about: fist sized sandwiches that will give you heart problems in years to come- but that give you now a meat-a-licious way to fatten up for the winter months.   Get a sandwich I tell you!  Atmosphere: Sporty. Big TV in back ground. I'm sure dudes watch games here.  Service: Meh- I think our waitress was really bored. It was slow- she was slow.  Would I go back? I think so.",neutral

"Went here simply because we are huge BBQ fans and with all the good reviews we had to check it out. I have to say, I wasn't that thrilled and it may be because of what we order, which was 2 sandwiches - 1 beef brisket and 1 smoked chicken. The beef brisket was very greasy and lacked seasoning this came with waffle fries which were okay- nothing special. The chicken was nice, well seasoned but they were a bit skimpy on the portion and I got a side salad with mine that came with a vinaigrette that was very spicy and certainly not a traditional salad vinaigrette. Overall, good service and decent food but nothing wild.",neutral

"So I have couple of different issues with WHASN but first let me say that aside from feeling like the doctors are literally shooing you out the door during your appointment I do feel MOST of the doctors are warm and knowledgeable.   1st issue- last year during my pregnancy at the beginning of the year I went from an insured patient to a cash payment patient, I paid everything I owed at the time of the visits. I paid $2k in cash for my upcoming delivery. But 6 weeks before I gave birth I obtained insurance -and was told by MULTIPLE office staff that with the type of insurance I had that I would be getting a FULL refund for the delivery fee 8 weeks after my son was born. 8 weeks passes by and mind you I was adamant about keeping in contact with the billing department to get updates on the status of my refund as I was told by office staff to do so. So 8 weeks passes and still no refund and every time I call I get the run around. I eventually have to resort to getting firm and directly asking for phone numbers and emails of office managers to resolve this issue to find out why my refund is taking so long, because no one knew anything. So cut to the chase 3 months after my son is born I finally get told a check would be cut that day and I could pick it up. I go to pick it up and it is for $1000. How is this possible? I paid EVERYTHING in cash up until my insurance took over which covered everything. So how am I not getting my full $2k back?? The lady working in billing instead of going over everything with me hands me a stack of my billing papers and tells me I am welcome to go home and check against my records. Excuse me? I'm not a medical billing professional and the paperwork she gave me looks like a foreign language to me. So there goes $1000 dollars thanks WHASN! Mind you this is not the first billing discrepancy I've had. When I was a cash payment client I was told my account had a balance during one of my next visits which was NOT true, and luckily I had the receipt from my last visit in my wallet to prove the mess-up was on their end. Someone in the office had done the coding wrong. So I have no doubt they still owe me $1000.   2nd issue- I cannot tell you how many times they have forgotten to send my prescriptions to my pharmacy, how many times I have called the nurses stations to try and get prescriptions changed where I DO NOT get a call back and I have even had a referral that never got sent that was for a skin cancer scare.  I feel as if WHASN has too many patients that staff cannot accommodate their needs promptly and properly. Also when you are pregnant, especially as a first time mother you would like to feel like you can speak with your doctor without feeling like you are being rushed out the door.   The only reason I have stayed with WHASN is because the doctors have now done 2 surgeries on me (ectopic pregnancy tube removal and cesarean section) and the they are fantastic as far as medical needs are concerned. But the treatment and the feeling rushed like cattle is starting to not feel worth it. So honestly I'm going to start researching a different doctors office to go to.",neutral

"I can't believe this is a triple A 4 Diamond Resort.    It's nice, it's updated, but the stellar service I expect from that caliber property just wasn't there.  Check-In was a complete ZOO.  The cordoned-off line snaked back and forth, with easily 100 people waiting, and there were 3 check-in agents.  THREE!  That process took over 45 minutes.  Although once I got to the counter, the Agent was friendly, chatty, and pleasant.  I asked for, and received, a comp upgrade to a larger, corner room with a Strip View and two windows.  The room is nicely appointed in contemporary fashion, which I love.  The bed was amazingly comfy, and the white sheets and duvet were clean and fresh-smelling.  Our view looked across at the Venetian from one window, and the other window was over the Pirate's Lagoon, where the free show, ""Sirens of T.I."" is performed multiple times nightly.  This was cool for us, since we are night people, but if you're not (why are you in Vegas?) the show has loud pyrotechnics and fireworks until 11pm.  Unfortunately, one night we were trying to get in a nap between daytime activities and nighttime activities, and the Cable TV was out.  This required four separate visits, in and out, over a 3 hour span, by maintenance and then the cable company.  They were very nice, but it was an inconvenience for someone trying to sneak some sleep into a Vegas Vacation.  Again, though, TI was generous with their comps, and we received a Buffet for Two comp as a result.  (Granted, I had to ask for it, but the front desk manager was forthcoming.)  (Also on that note:  The buffet wasn't even worth the free meal.  It was utterly awful. See my review)  The property is middle-of-the-road for Vegas Strip hotels.  It's not old and run-down like Excalibur or Circus, Circus, but then, it's twice the price.  And it's nowhere as nice as the Wynn or the Bellagio, but it's half the price of those.  So - Quite clearly Average.  (Do watch out for those pesky ""Resort Fees"".  If you book on the phone, they make it seem as if it's a one-time, per person fee.  It's not.  It's $20, PER DAY, PER PERSON.  Typically sneaky, and common at Vegas Hotels.)  Also: THE POOL WAS CLOSED!  We paid a resort fee to hear ""Yeah, but you can drive over to the Trump and use their pool""?  I don't think so.  Inexcusable, T.I.  The restaurants leave MUCH to be desired.  They have a deli, but why would you eat there when the Carnegie is a shuttle-tram ride away at the Mirage?  The buffet, as we've discussed, was disgusting, and the breakfasty-cafe place was ridiculously overpriced, even for the Strip.  ($14 for two eggs? Really, TI?)  Lastly, they have a Pho restaurant.  A Pho restaurant that serves Tripe but calls it Tendon (They are NOT the same thing!) and charges $19 for a bowl that would cost you literally $6 anywhere else in the US.  I'm just thankful I sampled it at the comped buffet rather than paying for it!  So overall, the property's rooms are clean and comfy, and at least they comp freely.  It's centrally located smack-dab in the middle of the Strip.  If you catch a fabulous deal, as we did, ($60 a night including Resort Fee) then it's probably a fine place to catch your Zz's in Vegas.  If you're looking for that signature Four-Diamond service, spend a little more and go to the Bellagio or the Venetian or the Wynn or.... you get the idea.",neutral

"Recently have been disappointed in this place, as the service is appallingly slow and the food quality has been slowly dropping (mainly looking at the Chu Chee Fish). Here are some of the dishes we've tried: - Chu Chee Fish: great flavorful panang sauce with crisp breading on the fish. However, the sauce will be spicy even if you order it at the ""no spice"" level- speaking from experience. The thickness of the fish has noticeably dropped over the months we've eaten here. - Yellow Curry w/ Chicken: a decent amount of meat with the curry; my only complaint is the lack of rice that comes with the dish",neutral

We did ask for bread which was a disappointment. It was day old and room temperature. My husband ordered the French onion soup and ribeye. He enjoyed the soup. The steak was just ok. He asked for steak sauce and they didn't have any! He thought it was tough and flavorless. Service was awesome but the need to step up the main course. Not everyone wants only apps.",neutral

"I have mixed feeling about my experience. The movers were very nice and courteous. The negative feeling came from the fact that I was quoted for an initial 4 hours and the move ended up taking 11 hours. We were charged for the entire 11 hours which I can only assume included time for lunch/breaks. The truck was not big enough so they also had to take 2 trips which transit time alone took almost an extra hour. Performance wise I don't have any major complaints. There were some occasions where I saw one person took 1 boxes at a time which I thought could be more efficient. But really in the end I just wish the estimate could have been much closer. I was prepared for the move to take 1-2 hours more than what's estimated, but was definitely not prepared for it to take almost 3 times longer. I would have been better off hiring an additional moving services because a second truck and 3 more movers could complete the job much lower cost than what we ended up paying.",neutral

Food: The appetizers are amazing from the hummus, Moutabbal (Grilled eggplant with tahini sauce), manakeesh (Middle-Eastern pizza), and huge house-made pitas. There are tons of desserts worth getting.   The mains however are just ok. I've had really dry chicken shwarma dinner in the past, but enjoyed the beef shwarma plate.

I finally walked a few steps over to the sushi chef and ordered the Spicy scallops and a cucumber roll.  The spicy scallop roll was bland, but the fish was good. The cucumber roll was very good.

Considering it's the only Pho place I have been to in Vegas, maybe I'm just too spoiled coming from SoCal where there's Pho places everywhere.  The broth had a different taste to it...and it was much heavier.. more msg?  The noodles weren't as soft (even after letting it soak in the broth for a while). The meat was okay, but there were pieces that did not look appealing.  The service was okay, they were nice.  They were very quick in seating 9 of us, but took forever in coming back to take our orders..We had to flag them down.  Also, they seemed a bit hasty in clearing our plates (maybe they were running low?).  It can be kinda awkward..especially when I'm still eating and they're trying to take my food away...

"The Skinny:  it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but that doesn't really say much (3) service - a little sluggish but then again, I came with the Yelp bunch so there was a lot of us. It took a while to get our orders but through the register (3) value - with the internet coupon, we got a soda and a large pizza for $14 between two people - not too bad.  We came here with low expectations of the food. Really, the main draw was to support the group of Yelpers in the Graziano's Monster Challenge (10lbs of pizza, 45 minutes). Shout outs to Jen S. who set up the UYE - it was a lot of fun for the supporters... er... maybe not so much fun for the competitive eaters - LOL!  Overall, for our food, I split a soda and pizza with my hubby for $14 (the soda was for me). The pizza crust had a nice crispness to the bottom however it was rather doughy for me. Toppings were okay - not great. I would say probably your average store bought pizza - nothing more or less.  The most impressive thing was our champion eaters - who would need to eat the equivalent of three large pizzas each to finish the monster challenge. Although ultimately none of the Yelp teams finished their 10 pound monster, it was enough to have tried to complete this difficult task.",neutral

"Like most people, social media definitely influenced me to visit Recess. I kept seeing these fish-shaped cones (or what I thought were cones) all over my feed and I knew I had to try it. I was stoked when I saw that a place in the valley finally offered them!  Unfortunately, the Taiyaki didn't live up to my expectations or the hype at all. I ordered the green tea Taiyaki with green tea and vanilla swirl custard on top. I also opted for the Nutella filling inside of the Taiyaki. When I received my Taiyaki, I didn't expect it to be so small! They look so much bigger on the Gram! Anyways, the Taiyaki itself was too cakey, almost like a cupcake, but a little more firm. Although it was small in size, there was no way I could finish it. It was too much to chew. The green tea and vanilla swirl custard was good... Super rich! It wasn't too sweet, which I liked. My sister ordered the taro Taiyaki and said that there wasn't much taro flavor. I probably wouldn't order the Taiyaki again, but I'm glad I tried it.  We also ordered a Vietnamese coffee and it tasted like a regular iced coffee. A little disappointed, but hey, they specialize in desserts, not coffee.  The staff was extremely friendly and offered to let us sample the different flavors of Italian ice with no hesitation! I'll have to come back and give Recess another go...

"I would give this place a 3.5/5 if I could. My friend and I have been coming here every now and then and from a food perspective it has never disappointed. The chicken tastes great. It is grilled to perfection and is always juicy and tender. The peri-peri sauce is addictive. We typically order the peri peri fries/wedges and mash potatoes. Stick with those as you can't go wrong with those. I mix peri peri sauce, ketchup and chili powder together and eat my chicken and fries with that. Try it!   The value is what brings Nandos down though. The portion is small and is somewhat on the expensive side considering what you pay for (close to $12 for a quarter chicken and one side). That being said, if something tastes good I have no problems paying a bit more.   If you're not sharing, pay a bit more and order the 1/4 breast and wing! The 1/4 thigh is so small it's laughable. Also, don't assume you have to buy a bottled beverage, ask for a glass of water!   Personally I don't tip when I eat here. There is hardly any service so why should you? Hmmm.",neutral

Its reasonable here.  The prices are okay for the quality of food you get and this was my first time coming here so ordering was a little different but its not my first restaurant ordering that way.  When you walk in you pass the first ordering window to get in line to order your food and seat yourself which is more convenient with getting your food the minute you order instead of waiting.  Everything is ordered separately meat sides and drink.  As for the barbeque sauce a lot of people were using the sissy sauce i prefer the other one its less sweet but just my preference.  I would like to see more sides on the menu and then maybe a cornbread instead of just regular slices of bread.

"My husband and I stayed here for only one night. I don't know if we would choose to come back because we had mixed experiences.   First, at check in, the woman at the counter was very friendly and helpful. Then we went out and decided to splurge for the $30 valet service.... You get in and out privileges. The people out front were absolutely NO help. We asked 3 people where to get our car valeted and people just left us standing there looking like fools. When finally a young man gave us a ticket and said he'd take it from there.   Up to the room, we were on the 20th floor, and had an INCREDIBLE view of the fountain and bridges. The room was beautiful at face value. The room was VERY dusty, though.... Don't look under the bed. Sheets were scratchy. Yes, the room was a little snug but my husband and I are from Chicago and used to actual closets so it was just fine for us.   The thermostat wasn't working and where our room faced the sun was setting directly into the room making us super hot. So we went to the front desk and a different girl was rude to us and not informative at all - but eventually we got maintenance to our room. We also asked her where to get wine glasses and she responded ""uh... I don't know, room service?"" She didn't offer to help us in anyway. So back up to the room we called room service and the woman said ""we're already doing rounds, come to the bar and we'll give it to you"". For a hotel that charges upwards of $230 a night I would expect the hospitality to be on point.   We needed the car later, I called down from the room asking valet to pull the car up. When we went down 10 mins later we stood there waiting... I asked someone eventually if our car was on its way and the valet said with a shrug ""I dunno"" when I could clearly see my keys hanging on the board. Finally, someone grabbed the keys and took off to get my car. I should also mention they don't take care of your car. The stuff I left in my back seat were on the ground and some flipped over. What did they do with it? Anyway. Not worth $30, not worth a tip (even though I did)  Stay here for the view, not the hospitality.",neutral

"I've passed this place several times and finally decided to stop by and give it a try. Overall first impressions were great - it's a nice clean modern space and I love that you can see the grill from up front as orders are prepared. There's also a salsa bar immediately when you walk in that has several options for all palates.   I was able to get my order in easily enough, but given that it wasn't all that busy, it took a while for my order to come out. There was only one cook on the line and one girl at the counter both taking orders and bringing food out.   The tacos I ordered were the pescado, bistec, and chicken and an horchata to wash it all down with. The bistec was a little bland and dry, which was a bit of a let down. The pescado and chicken tacos were alright, but not much about them stood out in terms of flavor. I will say that these tacos are reasonably priced. The horchata was alright - a touch too sweet but at least it wasn't excessively grainy as some places tend to make it.",neutral

"Got denied at the Princess of Wales theatre for the Book of a Mormon lottery so was on the prowl for something delicious to sink my fangs into (I mean teeth)...  Ordered the chicken tandoori kebab - To Go. I was first in line so it couldn't take too too long to receive my food.   Firstly, the place is quite modern. Clean and ample amount of seating.   Bathroom was spotless, which is a nice touch. I used the accessible 'suite' - they take care of this usual issue.   Food arrived - minimum 15 min wait. That means it's fresh...but wait.   Arrived to my post order destination, opened the take out container, andddd...was disappointed.   Firstly - way too much rice. Second - too little meat. Third - too little salad.   Rice was under cooked. Abrasive to the bite. Usually I look forward to the salad but the salad was sloppy and disappointing. Tons of lettuce, little veg, and too much dressing.   The meat - I've had really good BBQ chicken. But have you ever bitten into a chunk of chicken and questioned whether it was cooked or not. That's what I went through tonight. The left side of my brain said don't eat it - but the right side said eat it you fat pig.   Honestly, I won't go back which is a shame. I've been here before and the quality has gone down.",neutral

My friends got the set course meal: braised octopus starter, oyster starter, Lamb w/ risotto, creme brule. The octopus was strange because of the texture. I like the natural chewiness of the octopus, but braised octopus just tastes weird! The risotto was delicious and so was the lamb, and the creme brule was an excellent finish.

"Go during the right weekend and you can find a decent deal here. If it takes you more than an hour to drive here though, I'm not sure the trip would be worth it.  Parking first of all is a huge hassle. Get here more than 1-2 hours after the mall opens on a weekend and GOOD luck. I always come in the morning and by the time it's 1-2PM the parking lot is packed full and drivers are basically stalking people to their cars again.  There are sales that happen during some weekends and that's when the best deals can be found. If you come here and shop at the ""regular outlet prices"", the stuff simply won't be worth it. With an extra discount on top of that however, it may be worthwhile.  A few stores I've had experience with include: -Cole Haan: sometimes has some decent shoes for good price. I'm talking decent leather, fairly good construction, stitched-in insoles, etc. They're no Allen Edmonds, but they do make a good shoe for daily wear. -Asics: the items still tend to be a bit on the pricier side, but if you're looking for Asics gear, it's as good of a deal as you can get -Saucony: their clothing tends to be of lower quality than other brands from what I've seen, and less well thought out. But the prices are also cheaper. Shoes are typically around 30% off retail price (they carry last season's stuff), come during a sale and the prices are sure to be better. -Nike: never seems to go on sale. Prices as they are are better than other Nike factory stores in the GTA, so you might be able to get a decent deal here. But just keep in mind that Nike is what some refer to as a ""Fake outlet"" where the merchandise is often specifically manufactured for the outlet and of lower quality. -Ted Baker: when there's a sale on, you can get a good stuff for quite the price -J Crew: another ""fake outlet"" but the deals can be very good. I once got things for around 70% off! -Bose: just selling refurbished stuff at a discount, nothing special -Icebreaker: they sell nice stuff but even at the outlet prices are still ridiculous  There are also many womens accessories stores like Coach, Kate Spade, etc. that get crazy packed. Lineups all over the place. I guess the deals must be good.  Overall the mall is cleverly priced at a point where it's just about good enough to curtail most people from the hassle of taking a trip down to the States. Can better deals be had south of the Border? Absolutely. But this outlet simply makes it a bit more compelling to avoid that hassle.",neutral

We went in on a saturday night labor day weekend w/o reservations and ordered sirloin and ribeye with pork belly and heirloom tomatoes as starters.  waiter brings a huge plate of raw meat stacked on top of each other and begins explaining which one is which; this is a cool show but that's about it.  steaks were a bit overdone probably because the surface of the steak was real hard to begin with; i'm sure their meats were good, but just their cooking methods are questionable.  Pluses: oregon pinot was excellent, pork belly was better than the steak, heirloom tomatoes were great as well.  This is the 1st time that the starters were better than the entrees.

I thought the lunch price for the all-you-can-eat was a little steep with it being $23 per person, but there was a good variety of meats to choose from.  My brother was disappointed that the ribs were not a part of the lunch menu for all-you-can-eat, but they are for the dinner.  We also were confused on whether this price included tea, as he thought it did but it did not list this anywhere.    We enjoyed the spicy chicken, ribeye, and sirloin.  All the meats were really good also the ribeye was very fatty.    Service could have been better.  We asked for tea at the end of the meal which never came.

"Might get a higher rating for their regular meals, but the lunch special left much to be desired. Free egg rolls a plus, but the free soup was super salty! We were looking for a Thai experience.

Go somewhere else if you want good Thai food. Service was great. The ladies were really nice.",neutral

"Way understaffed! I stopped in on a Saturday about 1pm. With only 2 barbers working and 4 people ahead of me I expected a decent wait. By 1:30 I noticed the slow pace and asked how much longer - ""45min to an hour"" plus 30min or so for a cut, no thanks. While I was waiting I saw at least 4-5 people walk in and right back out. Obviously these guys are doing somethings right, but two barbers on a Saturday isn't gonna cut it in central Phoenix.",neutral
"I like Union Grill. The food is fresh and tasty, the atmosphere is cute and the service is good. I have no complaints, but it did not impress me enough to warrant more than three stars. I liked the variety of the menu and the veggies tasted fresh. This isn't the first place I would go looking for a healthy meal, but I was pleasantly surprised that the veggies were steamed without oil and the sweet potato that I had for my side was plain. As with most places, just order carefully to lighten up your meal. My table ordered a $10 bottle of Bordeaux and it was good! All in all, a good experience and I would go back if I happened to be in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to make a return trip.",neutral
"This place is deece--if you can get a table and deal with nightmarish Scottsdale crowds.  We tried to check Stone and Vine on what we thought was early a few Fridays ago. At 6:00 there was a 45 minute wait and the area around the bar was PACKED. Like, can't move. It looked like a country club convention threw up all over it. WINE WINE WINE, and middle-agers chugging it! It was kind of comical, but we didn't really feel like waiting in standing-room only for that long.  So I made a reservation last week and tried again. We were sat in the very back by the kitchen, but whatevs. Maybe they want women clad in rhinestone-adorned back jean pockets to walk in and see only familiar faces.   Service took a while, but I think it's because our gal was overwhelmed. I saw her party of 7 beckon her over to take their orders once she came by for our drink orders. And it took a while to get from the bar for drinks back to our table, roughly half a mile away.  The good though, was the food. The pizza was spectacular! I'm not sure how they made it so crispy/charred underneath and fluffy inside?! It boasted an garlicky olive oil base, covered in housemade fresh mozz, tomato, spinach and a sprinkling of ricotta, which I'll sub out for feta if I get it next time. Just needed a little flavor contrast.  Boyfran had the meatball panini, which he dubbed one of the best of all time. The salads we started with were amazeballs. Lots of veggies and fresh shaved parmesan on top.  We'll be back, but only with a reso and only to laugh at the crowd. Food this close to home cannot be beat.",neutral

"I've been here several times for both dinner and happy hour. Although I have usually had slow service, this Friday was the worst.  I came in with a group of friends at about midnight for reverse happy hour. We didn't leave until almost 1:30 and not because we were having so much fun enjoying happy hour. It took us 30 minutes to get our food after we ordered, except my boyfriend. He had to wait another 10-15 minutes for the manager to come out and tell him they actually ran out of the corn dogs he ordered. Someone else in our group had also ordered the corn dogs and gotten them, so I don't understand how it took another 15 minutes for the kitchen to realize they were out.  The food that we actually got just wasn't up to par. My friend's potato chips were kind of soggy. The beef tenderloin nachos I had didn't even have beef tenderloin! Instead, it had scoops of the meat from the sloppy joe sliders.   I understand it was a busy night downtown with the Sade concert and First Friday going on and that District was busier than normal. I appreciate that our server was super apologetic about the service. But the manager seemed like she could care less, and as an apology she offered us a free appetizer. After waiting for over 30 minutes for food, the last thing we wanted was more food. When my boyfriend asked if she could just comp his beer instead (which was cheaper than any appetizer) she made a face before agreeing.  My overall experience with District has been good, and I will be back. Their happy hour food is usually delicious! But if they can't figure out how to improve the speed of service and make consistently good food, I may have to rethink my decision.",neutral

"We've stayed here three weekends ago and we were stoked about getting a high-end stay and at really good rate. When I was younger, I've envisioned staying at one of these hotels to be like a vintage palace but only to find that wasn't the case.  The rooms were just okay and it was just a standard room.  Really, I was holding my breath before opening the doors thinking yes! a high ballers dream stay! when we opened the doors and turn the lights on then I thought hmmm...similar room like TI's but just slightly above average from that.  We had the fountain view room which was cool, you get a good clear view of the fountain along with the music playing when you have it at a certain channel though your TV. The bed comfort level was okay, spacious bath with tub, decent closet space and of course a flat screen tv.  The biggest cons that bothered us was the room temperature! We set the room control temperature at the lowest setting but we ended up with a not so good night sleep man, we had a warm night! I had to do away those comforters.  The casino level is in decent size, the club atmosphere that friday night was bumping with hoochie mamas waiting to get in The Bank (Club). Next morning only to find no more hoochie mamas but many golfer types and football fanatics during that Super Bowl weekend who were looking to eat or gamble.  Maybe I'm just spoiled from staying at many different hotels, hip, vintage,boutiques, motels you name it, but to pay for a high rate here for me, nah! I'm just glad we stayed here it did satisfied my curiosity and there goes one for my list of collection hotel stays in the Vegas Strip.",neutral

Not having a dust allergy would probably help, too. You can find old glassware, records, magazines from bygone eras, furniture, and, of course, vintage clothes. The clothing prices are eye-poppingly high in some cases ($60 for a polyester nightmare of a dress from the 70s? Really?). That said, it's still a fun way to kill an hour on a Saturday afternoon.

It was so bitter that neither my husband or I could eat it - it went straight into the trash. They smoke with White Oak, and the bitterness makes your toes curl.

The first glass - the actual glass itself - had been quite dusty. She completely ignored that - no comment, no apology. In fact, she treated us and the situation with disdain.

We had requested a table in the main dining room (for a party of seven.) When I found that we were being hustled to the closed off back room, I objected and we returned to the hostess stand. Mr. Jeff, one of several ""suits"" berated us for not accepting our assigned table.  He was anything but gracious. We were finally seated in the virtually empty main dining room. The menu was fairly new and the print is light and small (bring your glasses.) I looked for my Sunday favorite, the prime rib special but it was nowhere to be found. Our server, Jim said that they had removed it from the menu. Big mistake!! The next outrageous mistake is serving a choice grade of filet mignon rather than prime which everyone expects from a high end restaurant. You are paying for prime but are served choice. I can buy choice grade steak at any supermarket. I made some phone calls on Monday and found that while Morton's too serves choice filet mignon, Dominick's, Preston's and Mastro's serve the prime grade that you are paying for. Until Fleming's bring back the Sunday prime rib special and serves up a prime grade filet mignon, I will spend my hard earned money where I get what I paid for.",neutral

"A couple of weeks ago, I braved the fortress of Chandler Fashion Center in search of an engagement ring fit to rest on my girlfriend's finger.  Specifically, I took a trip to Bailey, Banks, & Biddle on her mother's recommendation and, knowing their reputation for service, embarked with confidence.  I was told to speak with Jeff, their manager, because he would treat me very well and perhaps even cut me a deal.  Jeff was nice enough, but I mean nice enough in a car salesman kind of way.  Peep these gems:  ""Well, you know we're owned by Zales so we only get the highest quality diamonds!""  I know you buy your diamonds from the same places as every other jeweler.  ""I must say, for your age you have excellent credit.  Just excellent.  We can go bigger if you want!""  I know I have good credit.  I also know you said that so you could get me to spend $2500 beyond my budget.  I almost did.  In the end, I did get a very nice ring that my now-fiance loves.  Jeff apparently wasn't able to negotiate on the price of the ring, but promised more flexibility with the wedding bands.

It was just Chef/Owner/Manager Leonard and one other employee when we were there.  The service was far from attentive but the food was enjoyable once it arrived.  I had the Greek salad.  The others at my table  enjoyed their sandwiches once they figured out which was which.  (They mixed up the two of them and served them backwards).  The fresh bread was a treat and the hummus was an odd texture, but it was tasty.    Would I rush back to Bambino?  Probably not.  And I definitely would not go if I were in a rush.

They didn't play any of the games over the speaker just showed them on the TVs which I would have preferred to at least hear the main game.    The bull was used quite a few times which was pretty entertaining. But if you decide to hang out there during Sunday Football I would suggest to get there around 12noon so you get a good seat or you'll be waiting about 30-1hr for a table.,neutral

"I wanted to give SanTan five stars. Perhaps our mistake was coming in on a Saturday night. The place was crammed full of people. You couldn't even walk through the restaurant without running into people.  We decided to stay anyway, and sat outside. It was pretty cool outside, but sitting near a propane torch heater helped. There were some people outside, but nowhere near as many as there were inside.  Here's where it gets odd, for me. Our server came up and introduced himself - after someone else had already taken our beer order - and vanished.  A third person brought us our beer and took my food order. Our server came back, said hi again, vanished. A fourth person brought the food. The mushroom burger *was* pretty tasty, I'll freely admit. The fries were good, too. Our server came back and asked us if we wanted another beer (we did). At this point I've lost track of the different people that have interacted with us tonight, so I don't know if it was a fifth person or one of the previous people coming back to bring our beer. At this point I didn't even know who we were tipping.  tl;dr beer's okay, burger was good, service was weird.",neutral

I ordered the pollo verde burrito, minus the beans. The service was fast and my burrito was ready quickly. I liked that it was wrapped in foil, which makes it easier to east on the go.  The flavors were pretty good. I enjoyed the chile verde quite a bit. The flavors didn't blow me away, but it was tasty. I will definitely be back to try out the other burrito options that are also cheaper. The price added up pretty quickly, so $9 for lunch seemed a little steep. I saw some other burritos priced at just under $5, so I'll probably aim for one of those next time.   Definitely a good option for a quick bite on the go.",neutral

"I came here with a friend on Reggae night (Sunday night) and it was a mediocre experience.   The drinks weren't very good but were priced cheaper than in old town. They came in plastic disposable cups instead of actual glasses. I found that different and interesting.  Only half of the club is used for Reggae Night so the place was small and although it got crowded by midnight, most people weren't dancing which was odd. By midnight anywhere in old town, people are dancing! I was very confused, especially since Reggae isn't hard to dance to.   The crowd was a bit older, maybe early thirties, some people were in their twenties. A lot of males, definitely disproportionate when it comes to the female to male ratio.   The service was 50/50, some people that worked there were very professional and helpful while others were not.   I liked the Reggae music, it was more modern than classic, but I didn't mind. They also played a lot of hip-hop, it was a mix, so not only reggae.   The bathrooms could use a little help, other than that the place was alright. The vibe was nice. They had a lot of strobe lights the whole time where as in old town strobe lights aren't used as much (more so at Smashboxx than anywhere else in old town). The smoke machine was working which I really like, you definitely don't see these types of effects in old town, again mostly at Smashboxx and sometimes at Maya or The Mint.   I asked someone who worked there what Friday and Saturday nights were like and he said the whole club is used unlike Sunday nights and it's packed, also on Fridays it's Latin night, and on Saturdays it's Hip-Hop night, so all in all he said those nights are better to visit.",neutral

"Picazzos is not very big and was filling up fast by the time we left. There is indoor seating, outdoor seating and a bar area. No exciting decor. Looks just like your standard Italian eatery.  This place prides itself on  it's organic and local ingredients. Which is great, but the price definitely reflects this.   According to our server, both the regular crust and marinara sauce are 100% dairy free, so I did a create-your-own pizzza with veggies and non-dairy cheese (I believe they use Daiya).  The pizza was good, but not amazing. I like a lot of Daiya on my pizza, so when I go again I'll definitely ask for extra. Also, I ordered spinach on my pizza and I felt that the spinach wasn't fully cooked, just a little wilted. I like my spinach fully cooked because I feel that adds more flavor, but that's a personal preference.  Our drinks took a while to come out, and for what we ended up paying we didn't get a heck of a lot. I'll definitely be coming back soon and see if I can't get them to veganize one of their specialty pizzas.",neutral

"Was it my leather wallet that upset the staff? You could tell that Urban Herbivore takes Veganism seriously even prior to you entering the place. There is a crossed-off fur sign (Canada Goose Jackets beware!) on the door that we thought was a symbol of their devotion to the cause.  However, there isn't as much devotion to the food. We had the Moroccan Stew with Quinoa and while the portion was huge the taste was somewhat bland and lacking.  Have you had a dish that you simply stopped eating because it was way too boring? Yes... this stew did not exactly set our taste buds to vegan-disco party.  And although it's a big portion the prices ($10) were not comparable with the value you are getting out of it, and for that price you could try out other Vegan food places in Kensington Market e.g. Hibiscus' Vegan Savoury Buckwheat Crepe.",neutral

"This place was just okay for my fiance and I. It was a nice place and have heard great things, so we finally gave it a try. I understand dim lighting but it was SUPER dark in the restaurant, little too much for me, but might be fine for others. He ordered the chicken, I ordered the burger. We also had the mac n cheese appetizer.  First, the mac and cheese was good, but it was ruined by putting salsa on top of it? That was a bit strange and wasn't a good mix in my opinion.  Second, his chicken was pretty bland and dry. It was just okay. For the money we were paying for that, we were definitely expecting something with a bigger portion and a lot better tasting! I ordered the burger medium well, it came out rare. I don't mind pink, but that was just too pink. I think he might have misheard me for ""medium rare"" instead of ""well"" which I can TOTALLY see and understand, especially with music playing. Unfortunately gave it back and did not order anything else or another one because it was pretty late and we wanted to go out. The drinks were good, nothing to write home about, but again these were EXPENSIVE.  Probably wont be back, nothing to memorable about this place except the high bill ;).

I just wanted one flower on the cake...I think they could have bent the rules for me, but no meant no.  The cake itself was decorated exactly how I had asked.

"The Flamingo: it's a fine place to crash. I stayed here in August on my first trip to Vegas, and I'd stay again. Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly.  THE GOOD: Great location (middle of the Strip across from Caesar's), excellent pools. The GO Pool, the one for adults, is everything you'd want a fun party pool to be, and they have nice thick towels that are unusually luxe for pool towel service. The rooms are cute enough, distinctive in style-- they don't look like a Motel 6. The room and bathroom were clean, and I liked that the duvet cover was washable and gave the impression of being very clean. I loathe hotel bedspreads, so that was a plus. I was on the fourth floor and my room was very quiet over both nights, EXCEPT for the moment when a man ran around the floor at 3 AM screaming like he was being chased by demons. That woke me up. But what do you want? It's Vegas.  THE BAD: Ants in my room-- seriously. C'mon, guys. I was flicking them off everything I left on the table. The shower was almost unusable. It came at one pressure setting-- ""wake up a blackout drunk""-- and the shower curtain was very, very friendly with me. I eventually put it outside the tub for a couple minutes, and in that time the firehose pressure of the showerhead practically turned the bathroom floor into Lake Mead. This is a desert, guys-- ever heard of low-flow?  THE UGLY: No outlets anywhere near the bed. This is 2014. We all lie in bed and play with our phones before we fall asleep, and wake up to alarms we set on them. If you don't have an outlet within reach of the bed, your hotel is stuck in the 1990s. Period.  Side notes about management: very long line for check-in even at almost midnight. Staff is friendly, however. Didn't encounter one staffer who wasn't a pleasure to speak with.   If you want classy or luxurious, stay at the Wynn or Bellagio. If you have money and want fun, stay at Caesar's. But if you're mainly looking for a decent place to crash once your three-foot-long daiquiri cup runs dry, the Flamingo will do ya.",neutral

The service wasn't the greatest but there was only one server and a few tables came at the same time, so I was understanding.  The menu has a decent selection of kosher fare, from burgers, chicken, steak, etc.  I ordered the Kabob which was not what I expected.  It was basically a hamburger on a stick, but the meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly and was quite tasty.  The french fries were excellent!  The person I was with ordered the steak and it was tender and tasted pretty good, not sure if it was worth $27 though.  You could probably get the same quality steak at Denny's, but it wouldn't be kosher of course.

"My wife and I have stayed at this hotel maybe 4-5 times, and at the Cabana suites twice. (Cabana review on their separate yelp page.)  For the main hotel, we've stayed at both the Tower rooms and the original rooms. The over-arching feeling I have, is that this place is really cool. You HAVE to appreciate the Cortez being one of the last of the original hotels/casinos in Vegas. If your into that more than anything, stay in the original rooms. Your room will have a tiny hint of years of nicotine, and a slightly audible sound track of all the action down stairs. (Especially in the bathroom.)  Personally, we're a little less keen on the smoke and noise; so the tower rooms fit the bill. Relatively new, well done decor, kind of reasonable prices for room service; and okay service. The shower has a small window that you can open if you like, which I found extremely nice/interesting. (Others might not.)  The Cafe has ALWAYS been a favorite. The food is actually REALLY good and has some of the most reasonable prices in Vegas. Service has always been really sh*tty, so just be prepared. If the cafe had a personality, it would be like Rainman's other talent was cuisine. The food is really good, but then the rest of the experience is enough to make you roll your eyes. Here's the formula: when you sit down, wait 5-7 minutes for your order to be taken, then wait 12 minutes. When your food arrives, they slap down your check, and aren't to be seen again. Really guys? (One last rip on the cafe service... if they had Keno runners, they'd probably make more money off of me. That would be nice.)",neutral

"It's not 1993 and the Excalibur is no longer the gem of the strip.

For my non-existent college student budget I'll take a $20 room any day over actually spending money to stay somewhere awesome on the strip.

"Recently relocated to Tucson, Arizona and there are no Filipino places around so we are constantly cooking it at home, boo hoo for us right? Any time we are in Phoenix however we stop in.  Sometimes you just want Mom's home cooking without having to work for it, and this place does the trick! Their tilapia tasted just like home, but I can't say the same for the adobo or pork menudo, in my pork menudo (respecting the fact that every Filipino has their own adjustments to this recipe, i.e. some use raisins some don't or some use achuete powder others not so much, you get it)...the ingredients however tasted old. Almost like they didn't sell it all and have been using the same batch reheated over and over.  The adobo tasted fine but there was also equal parts bone as there was meat in our served portion.   Sinigang was wonderful.   All in all the food was good and works for us when we have a hankering and happen to be in the city.

"I am impressed!   Thanks, once again, to Yelp!, we found great reviews here and decided to give this vet a try.  I confess, I was very demanding. I called to specifically get Dr. Koroknai to see my dog. I also contacted my previous vet to get the details (name, brand, code, dosage amount, and vaccination instructions) to relay to Dr. Koroknai's office.   They did not have the brand I wanted, or the single dosage (non-cocktail), so Dr. Koroknai went out of his way to order it! WOW! ***THUMBS UP!***  Still wary of vets, (due to one horrific previous experience - with a different vet), I had on my skeptical look the whole time, waiting to see what would happen next.   DR. KOROKNAI Dr. Koroknai inquired about her general health. Then he gave her a ""very general"" checkup, listening to her heart rate, took a look at her eyes, and weighed her. (My previous vet INCLUDED those PLUS looks at her teeth, her ears, and her anal area).   What impressed me was that Dr. Koroknai actually SHOWED me the packages of the  vaccination shots, just to prove he was indeed giving me what I had requested!  ***TWO THUMBS UP!***  Then, he explained WHY some dogs might get bad reactions from certain  vaccinations by explaining the process and ingredients used in these vaccinations! ***ONE PAW UP!***  Next, he gave my dog her vaccination shot, and asked me to wait 10-15 minutes after, just to see if there are any negative reactions. He explained what the typical non-threatening symptoms were (lethargy, soar spot, hot temperature or fever). But just to keep her cool and give her lots of water. I did not know about the latter. ***TWO PAWS UP!!!***  So far, my dog is acting normal and is laying on the balcony sun tanning. So I guess that means we'll be back here!   PRICE:  So unfair! Prices in Canada are 3 times MORE than the USA! What's up with that? Also, in the US, I would ONLY get charged for what my dog actually needed. Here, you have no choice. Any visit to see the vet INCLUDES a check-up fee, on TOP of services needed. (Meaning, you can not just come in for the vaccination). Lepto shots WITH check-up fee here are $59. Bummer. I called around, and apparently, that is just the way it is in the GTA.  TIP TO VET: Hopefully the new location @ 1012 Bathurst St. is newer, cleaner, and doesn't smell like dirty dogs baking sweets. (Seriously, it smelled like pets & muffins at the same time! Great way to kill your sweet tooth). But HOORAY for Dr. Koroknai!",neutral

Thank goodness I finally found ""my""  nail place. Monroe does my nails and she's wonderful. She always pays attention to detail and takes her time when she does my nails. She always does a perfect job so I'm officially loyal to the nail affair now.  Just a heads up... they're a bit on the pricey side ($55 for a full set) but imo it's worth the price because of the great quality and I don't have any issues with them.  However, the only reason I'm leaving 3 stars instead of 5 is because of the pedicure I received.   I ended up getting one of the more expensive pedicures ($50) and the girl who did my pedicure seemed lazy.

"I love a good German bier hall as much as the next girl, but this place really brings out my best and my wurst.   I've averaged the 5 and the 1 for a three star. I'd go back because it is so pretty, but I don't know that I would organize an event there in the near future either.  My first visit was during Oktoberfest, a bit of a gong show in the giant basement. Having just gotten back from Germany, it was fun to see the big picnic tables out and about, and the German band in full swing. The atmosphere was great, tons of people but still space to sit, our server was on it and the food that I stole off my friends plate was quite tasty! Overall, a 5 star experience! I love the decor - earthy, European, and just plain stylin'.  I was a little bit disappointed by the beer selection, but I grabbed the sampler, sat back and enjoyed the double headed bird decor. When we finally left a little bit early, I was surprised to see a big line coming out the door.  My second experience emphasized a lot of my bar pet peeves. First of all, I was late meeting some friends, and thought if I got there by 9, I'd beat the line. Not so. And not only that, the bouncer was not interested in letting me join my friends at their table and was downright rude. So, after a little friend- guilt tripping and a too long wait with them, we made it in for some increasingly bad service.  The drinks are, let's face it, overpriced for what they are, which I can live with when everything else comes together. But my second visit was a one star.

"A group of 8 of us walked into here and looked at the menu on the wall, first in shock over the prices listed next to the dishes. However, we found out that these were family sized plates to share. After the shock subsided, we decided to sit down.  We knew we wanted a salad, so the waiter had suggested getting 2 salads because each salad would feed 2 or 3 people. We got the mixed green salad, two of them. As for the main, we all decided to share the Eggplant Parmigiana and the Rigatoni & Broccoli. Again, the waiter suggested we get a third main dish as he didn't think it would be enough for the 8 of us, but we held off this time.   When the salad came out, boy did we feel the waiter kind of misled us. The salad was HUGE, it probably could have fed 5 of us comfortably. I don't know if it has to be said, but there was plenty of salad uneaten by the end of the meal. The salad was average, I think the only reason I enjoyed it was because I was craving greens/vegetables. Again, when the two main dishes came out, we were really glad we hadn't ordered a third main as the waiter advised. These family sized dishes are no joke. Nothing memorable popped out for me for the mains, I was hungry and I was full after I ate, the dishes were neutral to me - they weren't particularly bad or good.   If you want a place to just eat a lot of blah tasting carbs, this is the place for you. However, there are a lot of other options in the area. Plus, the per glass wine costs were a bit steep. Plus, the waiter was not friendly at all. That is all.",neutral

"Jaleo is a modern tapas style restaurant located in the Cosmopolitan. Hip, sparse lighting, and a menu that i couldn't stop ordering from. It wasn't only because the food sounded so amazing but also because the portions were certainly small. It is tapas after all. Even so, anticipate spending a few $ and ordering a lot of plates to feed a large group.   Make sure you order a pitcher of Sangria! Best sangria i've had in a while.

"Chicago magazine featured Nostrano 2 years ago and I've been wanting to try them ever since. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. My husband and I went here with another couple for dinner last night and I can't say we had a great experience.  First off we all ordered a cocktails and the salumi board to start with. We also wanted to order the scallops, but they were out so we decided to order the snapper crudo instead.   Drinks arrived and they were good. Interesting and refreshing, but not amazing. I can't remember the name of my drink but it had cucumber and gin and it was just a little off balance for my taste (too heavy on the sweet/cucumber). But my husband loved one of his. Unfortunately, one of the other people we were with did not like hers at all and never drank any of it.  The salumi board was great and a bunch of different wonderful meats to try and a nice pickled vegetable salad. The pate on the board was especially stellar. The crudo was just ok. The snapper itself isn't a very flavorful fish, but the ingredients it was paired with was nice. Unfortunately I got an extremely chewy piece and that kind of turned me off of eating any more of it.  My husband ordered the rabbit boudin blanc and confit and he gave me a bite of his nettle gnocchi that came with it and that was AWESOME. Perfect texture, creamy rich taste, delicious. I ordered the lamb ragu pappardelle and while I can totally recognize that it was a fantastic dish, it was spicy. There was definitely nothing on the menu to indicate that (though on the online menu I see now it lists harissa, it doesn't say that in house, it says cinnamon instead which is ""spicy,"" but not in the same way) and unfortunately it was too spicy for me to really eat and enjoy my whole dish. My friend ordered the tagliatelle with walnut pesto and she really didn't like it so I offered to trade her my lamb ragu since it was too spicy. But hers was oddly bitter (probably from the rye and radicchio) so I didn't get far there either.  In the end we left with a $200 bill and one drink completely not drunk and two dishes of pasta only eaten about 20% of the way. Pretty big bummer. The guys were happy, and my husband loved every single dish and would probably rate this place much higher than I, but I left hungry and disappointed. :(",neutral

"I've been here three or four times since they've opened, one which was their grand opening event. Seeing as I could almost hit their venue with a rock from my back door, I really want to love this place. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge supporter of the local craft beer scene in Charlotte and for that I will continue to give them a shot and let them get a few batches in before I swear em' off. However, it is my support of the craft beer scene that makes it hard for me to offer four or five stars (at least right now) when compared to the rest of the breweries in town. Honestly the third star is more for the venue, the vibe and mutual love of good live bands than the beer.  The one beer that I find myself consistently drawn to vs. the rest on the menu is the Friday Star IPA but when it isn't on tap or sold out, I find my visits short-lived.  Like I said, I'll continue to give Sycamore some time to perfect their brews and hope that I find myself updating my review in the coming months.",neutral

"Today, I was at Bell Rd. Toyota (20th Ave & Bell), having my vehicle serviced. After checking in my car, I went into the customer service lounge. As I am walking in I witnessed two of the dealership staff, a blue shirted service staff person and an office staff member in a dress shirt and tie, pillaging a vending machine. They were shaking and banging it so hard it sounded like there was demolitions taking place. The noise even startled to younger children in the lounge. Once these dealership staff were done one came out and announced... ""Anyone want chips?"" He had three or four bags to share.   I understand being frustrated with a vending machine but this is perhaps a little extreme. One could say they are only a couple few bags of chips but I want to ask...  If the staff is this causal about taking chips from the vending machine how are they about servicing our cars? I already don't trust dealerships now I am doubly concerned. Ultimately their ethical standards are in question.",neutral

"Okay, full disclosure time: The day we went it was about 98 degrees. I have no doubt this plays heavily into my overall review.  First of all if it is going to be hot the day you come, bring water AND AN UMBRELLA.  There is SOME shade, but not much.  The tour guides are tremendously friendly and happy to answer any questions that you have.  If you are interested in the Neon history of Las Vegas, this is the place to see the past.  I do wish they had some photographs or something to allow you to see the signs in their original glory. While I'm sure this is not possible for EVERYTHING here, famous ones like The Desert Inn or Sassy Sally surely they could do.  At some point there is going to be a ""Visitors Center"", so hopefully this will have something like that.  By all means I absolutely recommend seeing it if you can, but I'm not kidding about the heat.  My poor iPhone kept bringing up the Temperature Warning as I was trying to take pictures. But it was a wonderful opportunity to see these signs.",neutral
"It's been a long time since we were here.  I remember this being at least a 4-star place.  But based on this visit, I can't really go over 3-star.  By looks, the ambiance is fine.  ""Looks Japanese"".  But they play contemporary rock.  Doesn't fit.  It was enough that I noticed it, which isn't great.  We couldn't do tepanyaki (my first choice) because they had a ""large party coming"".  Several people showed-up, but there were still several griddle/tables available.  I assume they didn't have enough chefs to staff them, but don't really know.  If the room had been filled it would have been easier to shrug my shoulders and accept they had reserved the space.  But it wasn't, so it was a bit annoying.  So we grabbed a table.  We could have grabbed seats at the sushi bar, but we wanted some hot food too.  We ordered a few sushi rolls, and one stir-fried (I assume) beef and vegetable dish (I think it was called Yakiniki).  The rolls were fine.  Nothing really special.  Better than you get pre-packaged in a grocery, certainly.  But I've had better in other restaurants.  Not as good as I remember last time I was here, but maybe my memory is fooling me.  Given the pricing, it should be better.  Again, they were fine.  But not ""wonderful"".  The beef dish was disappointing.  Not much beef.  LOTS of mushrooms, plus some other veggies.  Sauce was nothing special.  Not bad, but I wouldn't order it again.  All in all, an unextraordinary meal.  It was fine.  But not as good as I remember, nor as good as I would expect for a place that charges what Ninja charges.  Glad I had a Groupon.  Helped defray my actual out-of-pocket, so that was nice.  If the service had been better I might be able to give 3.5 stars.  But service was inattentive, and inconsistent.  Sometimes it was cheerful, and other times it was impatient.  From the same server over a matter of 10 minutes.  Very strange.  So three stars it is.  I would not avoid this place, but I won't make a point of eating here again either.",neutral

"- Service was good - We ordered:  + Tuna Kinilaw which was tuna sashimi with some kind of sour sauce and shrimp chips, it tastes ok to me but my bf thought it was good   + Chicken Adobo is basically bake chicken with soy sauce that I usually cook at home, nothing special. Definitely not woth $20    + Ginataan is deep-fried cauliflower with little cuts of coconut, it was good   + Garlic rice to eat with the meat, went pretty well   + Flan cake (i don't remember the entire name) it's like a purple ube pudding on top and cheese in the bottom, decorated with couple drops of lemon juice and tiny pieces of grapes. This cake was a signature of our night, I thought the flavour blended super well together and totally different from the flans that I usually have. - Price varied from $10-20 per dish - Will not come back again because the food is like typical asian/chinese food that I can make it at home.",neutral

"Being a poker fan I'd heard about the Binions Cafe and that is was pretty good (good food reasonably priced).  A few years I read a book, Positively 5th Street (which the author enters and does well at the world series of poker) where he raves about the food at Binions.  Anyways if you are in the mood for greasy food at good prices check out the Binion's cafe.  I ordered a grill cheese with ham.  What i ended up getting was like nothing I imagined.  I received a sandwich stuff with tons of super greasy ham and cheese (tons of greese!).  Despite the fact that it probably took a couple months off my life the meal wasn't bad.  I was a bit hung over so my body actually appreciated this meal.  Binion's to me is almost a historic site.  It's somewhat painful to see them move away the world series of poker, then shut down the hotel rooms....my hope is that the casino and food establishments aren't the next to go because that would indeed be a sad sad day....",neutral

It was all around good food, but I didn't walk out of there feeling like I had an phenomenal tasting experience for the price.  I hate not 5-starring this place because the whole establishment to include the staff are well thought out and great, I just didn't love the unique brand of food.  I would recommend trying Paid In Full if pop-Asian-fusion is your thing because it's unique, and though food didn't speak to me, I can see how someone could enjoy the flavors.",neutral

"The owner replied below. Here is my reply. I HAVE had eggplant parmesan at your restaurant before and it was fine, as can be expected, it fitted the common expectation and standard description of the dish. Whatever i had w that alfredo sauce was not that, it was haphazardly thrown together, barely eatable and by no standard of any italian cooking can it be called an eggplant parm ( a dish i usually LOVE), for one there was no parmesan cheese in it. The dish was just eggplant, not well cooked, not good, covered in sauce with random chunks of mozz & ricotta cheese. I'll change my stars from 1 to 3 because i feel bad letting my bad experience affect your business, my issue is more w the waiter who Claimed he saw breadcrumbs. But  to keep telling me that what i was served was not a mistake, that is some version of the dish, is ridiculous.   I really want to like this place, it's cute, but when the attitude is so hoity you better come correct..and it just dont. Tonight's dinner was a travesty. I ordered an eggplant parmesan w Alfredo sauce instead of marinara. It came looking odd. I questioned it but was assured by waiter that it was normal. It wasn't, all this was, was a stack of dry thick eggplant with chunks of ricotta, mozz & alfredo thrown on too. It was not at all an eggplant paRm, i decided to make the best of it, cus they act at this restaurant like complaining or questioning is strictly forbidden. Before leaving I reported to the waiter, just as an Fyi, that mine was really not an eggplant parm, and he started arguing w me. I said ""i've had it many times, it's supposed to be thin sliced eggplant fried in breadcrumbs and parmesan etc"". he said : ""i saw breadcrumbs"" what?! Where?! I think i know what was in it, i ate it and am telling you what was on my plate in front of me for 20 min. I didnt send it back out of courtesy, hated that ineatable slop, paid for it, tipped well, and they can't even give me the courtesy of taking my notes at face value? I understand mistakes can be made, but when they look you in the face and deny the glaring obvious issues like you're lying or irrational, then i get lit.

"We had to check this out while I'm Phoenix because it was rated so highly of Trip Advisor. The design is great as everyone gets their own set of headphones and the music automatically starts playing when you walk up to each exhibit but this place definitely isn't for everyone. If you're really into music and history, you'll love it.. but if you're not then you'll become bored pretty quickly. I wish there were more exhibits that featured modern day musicians and less of the different countries because although interesting, they all were so similar. I wouldn't recommend bringing young children here because there's only one room where they allow you to touch the instruments and the rest of the exhibits aren't the most child friendly. Although it was interesting to see once, for me once was enough. Again if you have a strong interest in music history, you will love it..but if you're only somewhat interested like me then you'll get bored pretty quickly.",neutral

Because I was staying in Planet Hollywood, and I'm lazy, I ate here for dinner and then again for breakfast.  At dinner, some of the food was pretty good, like the tandoori chicken, seafood enchiladas, and the barbecue ribs, but most of it was just ok.  The service was decent, but that changed the next day.  At breakfast, food again was mixed quality.  The tri-tip steak was delicious, potatoes were good, fruit was decent, most the other stuff (eggs, pastries etc.) was ok.  But the service was fucking awful; we waited about 10 minutes before our server took our order, and when I needed a refill it took a good 15 minutes before our server came by.  And when my friend asked him to replace her OJ because it was super watery, he gave us attitude and told us there was fresh-squeezed OJ at the buffet (which was not true).  He was a dick, and for maybe the first time ever i didn't leave a tip at all.

"Although the convenience store is called Sun City Express, the gas station itself is Sinclair. I come here because they have the lowest price on gas around my part of town (or any part of town really -- and I drive ALL over town because of my delivery job); however, my main gripes are that half the time I go get gas, they don't have receipt paper for self-serve users and at least 1 or 2 self-serve machines for gas are out of order. Half the time I go here, I can drive in and out with no sweat, but half the time some sort of problem arises when it comes to using the self-serve credit card stations.",neutral
"Upon walking into Pho Cao I immediately felt the dive bar atmosphere as has been pointed out previously, with music playing a bit too loudly for my taste. However, it felt cool and the employees were really friendly, my server also knew his menu well.   I ordered the Spider Crab Spring Roll (Goi Cuon Cua Lot), Fried Chicken Dumplings (Ha Cao Chien), and the Ramen Noodle Pho. The softshell crab was my favorite, felt really fresh and healthy. The ramen pho was also good, but nothing special. I was kinda disappointed over the dumplings, the consistency of the chicken was a bit bland and the overall dumpling was doughy. Finally, the price was kinda steep. Therefore I give the whole experience 3-stars.    Although the food wasn't great, I would come back to one of their nightly events. As I wrote previously, the staff were friendly and I felt the atmosphere was cool. They organize open mic nights, karaoke, and have live performances. So that's definetly something to check out!",neutral

"Black Truffle Carbonara Tagliatelle, sitting at the top of the menu at $18.99, had the honour of being my lunch today. Garnished with healthy grating of parmesean, pea shoots, a raw egg and grated black truffle, this sizeable dish certainly looks to be delicious, but was it?  After combining the egg with noodles (which I thought was more fettuccine than tagliatelle), I dug into the quite sizeable portion, whereupon my first bite revealed not a fresh, perfectly al dente pasta, but a formerly dry noodle that spent an extra thirty seconds too long in the bath. Pushing aside my disappointment, I turned my attention to the unmistakable delight of black truffles which single-handedly carries this dish (and also dominates over the other flavours). While containing pancetta, a raw egg and cheese, I found the flavour of the sauce to be single dimensional, with consistency on the looser side. A little more richness to better bind the sauce to the noodles at the beginning, instead of leaving a pool at the end would have been welcome. It isn't to say that this dish wasn't good, but the potential is there to be great.  In terms of service, our party was a large group of nine with five other tables of two in the restaurant. Our dishes came out staggered, with the first diner finishing before the ninth diner received their meal. This was explained to us that there were only two chefs in the kitchen and as a consolation, we were offered a gratuitous drink - a choice of lemonade or blue raspberry lemonade. I chose the latter, but received (what I am sure was) blue koolaid instead. Recommendation: forego this.  In general, the size of each dish is quite large (ravioli notwithstanding), and the value for each is quite high. With that in mind, if you come with the expectation of an average meal at a reasonable cost, you would not leave disappointed. Just don't drink the koolaid.",neutral

"A popular tacos restaurant that has been popping up in several locations around Toronto along with it's ever popular sidecar business of Sweet Jesus. We walked in on a weekday looking for a late dinner and was greeted by a sparsely lit space with booming rap music. I'm not sure what I expected from a tacos place, but it definitely wasn't darkness and a heavy bass.   Decor, music and atmosphere aside, the food itself was a hit and miss. The Avocado Mango Salad was fresh and bright, a great accompaniment to the tacos. The Carne Asada taco was delicious, the beef steak was tender and balanced perfectly against the toppings of salsa, avocado and cilantro. The In Cod We Trust taco was really odd, something about the toppings and the fish didn't work for me. Maybe it had too much red cabbage? I didn't like that one. Also, the portions are small for the price. After two tacos I would be normally still be hungry if it wasn't so late at night.   In all, the experience was okay. The tacos are good but pricey and small.",neutral

"Staying at the Nugget and looking for a nice dinner close by. Went to the Grotto around 6 on Monday. No reservation needed, although the place started filling up an hour later.   Service was a little spotty at first, but got better as the meal progressed. The fresh bread and seasoned olive oil was excellent. I had the Pollo Francese, which was just slightly overdone, but still good. My wife had  the Shrimp Griglia, which she liked. Just enough garlic to require a stick of gum after, but not enough to taste the next morning!  The best deal of the night was a Rigatoni Bolognese special for $10. Two of our friends ordered that dish, and they both felt they got their money's worth.   One disappointment is the inability to order a side salad with dinner. One of our party asked, and she was directed to the main salad menu, starting at $10. Missed opportunity, folks. You likely would have sold several salads at $5, but instead we kept asking for the free bread.   If you're looking for an easy, somewhat upscale alternative to standard downtown fare, the Grotto is a nice go-to in a pinch.",neutral

"Located right off the casino floor in the Cosmopolitan, The Henry is a classy, fancy looking restaurant that serves up classic American diner food. It was about 8pm, and the restaurant was pretty empty so we were seated really quickly.  We started off with some buffalo wings, which were pretty spicy! They were cooked really well, and we were also given wet wipes to clean up the unavoidable mess that comes with chicken wings. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, but had asked for the blue cheese dressing to come on the side. Unfortunately, when it arrived, I was disappointed to find out that it had not come on the side. The chicken was kind of soggy from all the dressing and water from the tomatoes, that it wasn't really that enjoyable. It was really flavorful, however, and tasted just like the chicken wings!   I opted to order the sandwich with a side of tater tots, which they fry in truffle oil. I had never had truffle oil before, so I was put off by the smell, and had to remove the tater tots from in front of me because it was so nauseating. This is nothing against them, just something that I wasn't expecting.  Overall, I would not pay the price we did for this meal, but it is pretty standard in the Las Vegas area. Other than forgetting my request, our server was really friendly and quick. They also serve breakfast all day, so it's kind of like a fancier and more expensive Denny's, and the quality is not much better than I what would expect from Denny's either.",neutral

"We had to wait because they only had one server.  Several people came in and left when they were told they were understaffed.  The waitress was odd to say the least.  She was not talkative at all and did several odd things. She brought the food and held a plate and just hovered it above the table for us to move stuff and never said a word.  I asked for a refill and received one but she never asked my friend.  She brought containers to the table and then came back and took some of the containers and gave them to another table.  I told her we needed three and she said oh I shouldn't of taken them :/ she asked us several times if we were ready to put the food in the containers and we said we were still chatting that we would do it soon.  She came over another time and started putting the food in the containers and slopped the noodles everywhere.  There were several noodles in the bread basket and on the table.  The food was fabulous but wow, Krista must of been having an off day.  I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt, maybe the other server called in sick and she had to come to work when she wasn't planning on it.  It was just odd.  I'll probably return to see if the service improves.",neutral
"Dates of stay: 6/23-6/25/18  My husband and I are Wyndham timeshare owners. Our properties were not available for the dates I needed so I booked via RCI Exchange and used our points. I'm unable to speak of the actual rate charged but the RCI fees were reasonable. I was charged a $100 refundable security deposit.  The property spans across Lindell. Unfortunately we checked in late so there were no non-smoking rooms available on the main property site. The front desk called for security to escort us to our room since we did not have a car. The response from the security via the walkie was unprofessional. We ended up walking to our room rather than waiting the 20 minutes he told the front desk. This meant we rolled our luggage with us right along Tropicana Ave. It was about a 5 minute walk so it wasn't too bad.  We were in room 2001A which meant we needed to access the floor from the elevator in the main lobby. Once you're off the elevator, there are two sets of doors: one leading to rooms and the other leading to another wing of the hotel, which is where we needed to go. I tried the door several times only to go back to the front desk and guided another route which meant taking the stairs.   We finally found our room and it was perfect for what we were looking for. There is a fridge w/ freezer, microwave, utensils, dishes, dishwashing soap, sponge, paper towels, shampoo & conditioner, soap, & hair dryer. Everything we needed was right there. The bed/pillows were comfortable. Although our room was close to Tropicana Ave / Lindell, we didn't hear any noises from outside. The only vending / ice machine is in the main lobby of building II near the breakfast dining area. We didn't get to visit the pool but I took a peek and it was smaller than your average resort pool. Keep in mind check-out is 10am. I was lucky the front desk called me at 9am to give me a courtesy reminder.",neutral

"Checked out The Patio after seeing the reviews and a feature in some article about it being a ""hot place"" to eat in Vegas now.  I'm from Toronto, so we have quite a few of these places scattered throughout the city.  HOWEVER, I must add that I don't think the Toronto places offer homemade ice cream or cakes that look relatively homemade.  We do have a fair share of tea places, so after following the hype, I thought this place was just OK.  Perhaps my impression would've been better if I had tea/piece of cake, but I was absolutely stuffed, so decided on homemade ice cream instead.  It was very good, nice texture, but they had run out of 1 out of the 2 toppings I selected.  Menu is somewhat limited and I've posted it so you can see their offerings.  It's basically an Asian tea place - NOT boba/bubble tea, that offers both hot/iced teas (~$5ea), with a handful of desserts including Asian inspired cakes, HK waffles, toast with some accoutrements, etc. but furnished in a way to look as if it's outdoors.  A great addition would be a green tea/sesame soft serve machine.  I think that would be a nice addition to the menu!  Service was just ok too.  Nothing memorable.",neutral

Hot and fresh pizza.  They say it is all natural, fresh and homemade.  The pizza is put in a plastic wrap with parchment paper under it.  You cook it on the parchment paper, take it out of the oven, let it cool a few minutes and then it is time to eat. The menu includes some fresh salads and some sweets including cookies that you bake.  This take N' bake concept can be OK in some cases, but I usually want my Pizza cooked so I can eat it now.

"The ""sister"" property to the Venetian, the Palazzo has many of the same amenities that you come to expect.   All rooms are suites. . . large sprawling rooms with 3 flat screen TV's, a separate sunken living room with a sofa sectional (doubles as a sleeper), desk and table, and a bed with tons of pillows and comfy linens.   My favorite feature? Don't laugh but they have motorized curtains that allow you to lay in bed and via remote control open the draperies and raise and lower the Roman shade. (yeah . . .sometimes it's the little things!)   Room service is expensive (what isn't in Vegas?) and when they have a large group in the hotel- wait times can be over an hour and a half so plan accordingly. On three of the mornings I was here- the wait time was over an hour and the woman on the phone actually tried to talk me out of ordering . . . .and that wait was for cold cereal and a pot of coffee . . nothing even needed to be cooked!   I know the goal of every hotel is to get you out of the room and into the casino but my wish was to have some basic amenities included. A coffee pot would have been nice so that I didn't have to pay $26 for a pot each morning or get my bed weary body up and down in the casino to wait in line for a cup of ""joe"". Also-they charge $12.95 for Internet which also makes me nuts.   Finally- I don't know if it was just ""off season"" or what- but service at the pool area is pretty non existent. Only one of the 4 days I was there was I able to find a server.   And just when I was settling in- the server came by to tell me it was ""last call"". At 4pm? I get that they wanted to close the pool- but there were plenty of people out there worthy of keeping the pool open at least until the sun went down.   The room rates are on par with other nice hotel in Vegas- (we had a group rate of around $188 but the normal price is usually around $250). Check your reservation before going so that you know which Tower your room is in (Venetian or Palazzo) for if you check in at the wrong Tower- you will have quite the hike to get to your room.   Hotels, for me, are all about the level of service you receive. The Palazzo, does okay as it is certainly functional- but the beauty of the hotel sets you up for a bit of a let down. After all- how could some place that look so nice, stumble in so many basic service areas?",neutral

"This restaurant offers the standard Vietnamese food you would expect if you have ever been to a noodle house. We had the Bun Thit Nuong (Grilled Pork with Vermicelli) and Grilled Pork with Rive. Both dishes tasted as expected. We checked-in on Yelp for 2 free egg rolls and they tasted good, but didn't look good. Judged purely on looks, the rolls were cracked.  One thing about the vermicelli dish is that the egg thing that came with it was severely burnt, so I passed.  Overall, I'm glad we had lunch here because it offered something I was use to. There are probably other places that are just as good or better, but we stumbled upon this one.",neutral
"Delivery took about an hour or so but it is a busy weekend. The pepperoni pizza was very greasy and hardly any sauce.

"It's 30 bucks for a mani/pedi here, which I saw on the sign outside while driving home from work. ""Ok"", I told myself ""if there's a parking spot within the block, I'll go try it out."" There was, so I did. I'm not usually one to try out a nail spot before hearing reviews, which I why I wish I had read up on them on Yelp before heading inside.   You definitely get what you pay for with this place. After choosing my polish, I sat in one of their chairs. The massage-chair controllers were wrapped in dirty saran-wrap which was my first clue about the general cleanliness of the place.   The actual pedicure was well done. She payed attention to my callused heels and cuticles, but I was worried about how clean her tools were the whole time. She finished up the pedicure with a foot and leg massage, which was unexpected (I thought I would be rushed out for sure) and was given paper slippers so I could walk over to the manicure table.  The manicure was done by the same girl. No chit-chat, just a quick (and I mean QUICK) no-frills buff and polish with some cuticle trimming. A hand massage followed, which I could have done without; the cream she used was really floral and bothered my nose. I would ask them not to use it if I ever go back.  This is definitely a two-stars kind of place, but I gave it three because I got what I expected. You can tell from the look of this place (and the price) that it is not going to be fancy, nor the most sterile. I'll go back if I find myself needing a quicky on a budget, but I think I'd rather spend an extra $10 - $15 and go somewhere I feel more comfortable and clean.",neutral

"Went in here because I was craving asian food, and the sign clearly advertised ""pan-asian"" cuisine. I don't see what's so ""pan-asian"" about the place-- seems like your ordinary Chinese restaurant to me. I needed some lunch so i decided to give it a shot, so what the hey?  The management seems nice enough. Clearly it is owned/managed by actual chinese people so i suppose that ought to be somewhat reassuring when seeking out any sort of ethnic cuisine. The lunch special was well priced at 6 bucks, and included an egg roll.  The egg roll was your average spring roll. Probably would have been nice if it had been served with some sweet and sour sauce but I was too lazy to ask for some. I ordered the szechuan chicken, an item that you don't always see at your typical chinese fast food restuarants. It was decent-- fair amount of sliced chicken served with sliced onion, bell pepper, carrots, ginger and glazed in a dark sauce. It was quite salty and did not require additional soy sauce ( i imagine that was already added) and the spiciness seemed to come from some sort of pepper oil. It was spicy enough to satisfy my palate-- I didn't feel the need to ask for additional hot sauce. I was satisfactorily filled and thanked them for a pleasant meal.  The verdict: Nothing special to say here, this is your run of the mill sit down chinese restaurant. The food quality is good enough to earn your business, but I don't think it's worth going out of your way for. You could probably find tastier food at a PF changs to be honest but these guys aren't a bad deal if you find yourself in the spring valley area.",neutral

The food is okay if youre starving but there are much better buffets at other hotels. Other than the location and buffets, this place was a clean place to stay which matters most to me. The pool and hot tub were very big and nice and we had a great view of it from our room.

"I came here on Wednesday evening to have dinner at the recommendation of my hotel concierge. The restaurant itself is located in an old stable, so it's a really interesting venue. The restaurant is also located in old Montreal, a historic part of town with some really interesting architecture and old buildings. The service itself is quite nice, attentive, and responsive.  I ordered the ribeye, or what they referred to as the Gibbys cut, which was a standard 22oz steak. Being in Montreal, I wanted to try a steak with true Montreal seasoning, and it actually was much less salty than Montreal seasoning rub you would buy in a store, which I liked as most places tend to over salt their meat.  One thing to note is that their medium rare It's probably a little bit more rare than you would typically expect. Also, they only season one side of the meat which was a surprise to me. The cut of meat wasn't spectacular for a ribeye steak... it didn't taste that spectacular. The asparagus that came with the steak was also not season at all and tasted like it was simply blanched quickly.  When you order a steak it also comes with a side and a salad. The salad had a dressing mixed in which I asked for to be on the side but the salads were premade so the only thing the waitress could do was request a light dressing -- it was tasty but still a bit too heavy on the dressing for my taste.  The Monte Carlo potato is basically one where they scoop out the potato, mash it and add bacon bits, chives, etc, and stuff it back into the potato.    Menu price ~$54.  The ambience is nice, and you don't have to cook it yourself, but an average tasting ribeye, blanched asparagus, a salad, and a baked potato for that price just felt a bit too high.",neutral
"We sometimes go here for their lunch buffet on a Friday. It's just a short walk down from the North York Centre subway stop so it's quite convenient to get to.  The lunch buffet is $11.99 and has all the regular dishes that you would normally find in an Indian buffet. The food, for the most part, is really tasty (their Butter Chicken is fantastic) although I can't say that I'm a big fan of their Tandoori Chicken...  I find it to have an overwhelming flavour of charcoal.  This place isn't much to look at on the inside and I reckon they could do a little work on the outside to give it more curb appeal but the service is friendly and the seating area is well laid out.",neutral

"This place is classic east coast Italian, with parking in the rear and an unmarked back door entrance included.  Definitely a run down, hole in the wall type of place with a musty smell and a decor I'm sure hasn't ever changed in the decades this place has existed.    Five of us came in on Saturday night on a whim to ""try something different"" from our usual haunts.  Boy was this place different!  We sat in the bar area where several tvs were showing the cards preseason game, and one muted tv was on the sound of music...  There were 3 or 4 other parties in the bar area, average age was approx 68.  Fortunately none of them really had any problem with our obnoxious drunkenness.  Not sure how many people were in the dining room portion of the restaurant, but suffice it to say the place was far from empty, which is always a good sign.  But there was only 1 bartender/waitress working in the bar area, and though we were more than patient and amiable, she was still very flustered with her duties.  Eh, we were drunk and didn't care.  On to the food.  We ordered the eggplant rollatini and mozz sticks to start, a pizza, manicotti, chicken parm, and fettuccine alfredo.  Everything was pretty good, huge portioned, relatively cheap, traditional italian(-american) food.  It really hit the spot!  The marinara sauce was incredible, and the manicotti was bursting with ricotta.  The pizza was good, the chicken parm standard (the spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente), and the fettuccine was probably the loser of the group (my meal, of course) - it was good, but not as creamy as I had hoped.  All in all, this was exactly the type of experience we expected and went looking for.  I honestly have a feeling we'll all be back.",neutral

The bread... well, it ran #3 in the ""not so special"" race.   FINAL ACT: I'll try it again and get the other options, i don't like to lable a place off 1x going no matter if the 1st time is Bad or Good.  Credits:  Mike S as Himself Grumbles as itself",neutral

"Noodles were decent, but I was a bit let down by the bowl of ramen I had here.  Could have hyped myself too much and expected a lot.  Overall the dining experience was okay.  The place was about a 30 minute drive if you are coming from uptown.  And the dining space was very cozy... 8 tables total.    We got there right at 7pm on a Sunday... and the place did fill up after we sat down.  Our server was nice and gave us a lot of time to peruse the menu.  Ended up getting the YUME hamachi appetizer (price was incorrectly listed on the menu, but the server came by to check with us if the increase in price was ok).  And then I ordered the spicy miso ramen bowl... which was good.... but the pepper strings in it really just blew my pallet out and I wasn't able to enjoy the rest of my meal.  I want to just mention that Charlotte/Matthews ramen scene is still relatively young so I expect these trail blazer restaurants to have their food on point.  The few other places that do offer ramen are ranking a little higher than YUME in my book.  I will have to come back and try another ramen bowl (maybe not the spicy one) but I am really glad to see a place like this open up in the suburbs because it shows the diverse food culture that North Carolinians are ready for and craving.",neutral

"The gyros I have eaten on many a drunken night here really remind me of the gyros I have eaten on many a drunken night in Chicago. And so does the seedy, butt-ugly atmosphere of this place. But if eating some of the best gyros ever in Chicago has taught me one thing, it's not to judge a gyro place by its cover. Parthenon Gyros is no dirtier than the kitchen located right next to the counter, in true big-city style.   The fries are usually cooked and seasoned very well, and they don't do a bad job with things like the spanakopita either. I love the tzatziki sauce; you get a good 50/50 mix of yogurt and mint in the aftertaste. Like every other topping, including the gyro meat, it is generously piled on top of the bread (another one of their most outstanding ingredients).  Parthenon is very fast-foody, but I don't know a good gyro place that isn't. So if you want to escape the dining room that looks like a bathroom, go to the rooftop tables. You can watch State Street go by while you eat one of the best gyros in Madison.  Oh, and they serve beer.",neutral

Great portion size on the Quesadilla.  A bit of fat but that's normal in carne asada.  Scratch that.  There's a lot of fat.  Should have gone with chicken.  Great salsa.  Good cheese.

"Overall this place does a decent job.  That being said, it is super clear that pepper is their favorite ingredient.  I ordered a pork chop for dinner and it comes with a pepper sauce (thankfully on the side).  I chose sides of mashed potatoes and buttered corn.  The corn had so much pepper in it you could almost not see the yellow.  It barely tasted like corn at all and I couldn't eat much of it.  Our server was exceptionally friendly although really slow to bring things like butter or water refills out.  She did bring fresh rolls because she took so long to bring the requested regular butter.  Apparently they were having a server meeting in the kitchen and you can't leave the meeting even if you have a guest requesting something.  I don't think that is a good practice at all - your guest requests should come before a staff meeting.  All the servers had to do a line dance of sorts during dinner also and it was pretty clear none of them were jazzed about having to do it.  Seemed kinda hokey - something more appropriate for a bar in Mexico than a restaurant in Phoenix.  But back to the food, my pork chop was absolutely delicious and the mashed potatoes were very good also.  Only thing I would advise is lay off the pepper. And if your buttered corn is actually peppered corn, it should be advertised as such.",neutral

The cashiers specifically are already showing signs of being burnt out and customer service/friendliness is nearly non-existent when ordering your food.

"Eh. I've been in here a handful of times now. It's okay.   The place is typically organized well, stocked to the gills, and bright. That's a plus. The staff has always been friendly. But what gets me is the pricing compared to the quality.   Today I stopped in to look at some party stuff for an upcoming Bachelorette party. They had a decent selection of items, but the prices for the primarily all plastic, cheaply made items, just seemed too high. If the quality of the products were higher, I wouldn't have as much issue paying those prices.   This place is a good spot to get balloons, though, as well as plastic cutlery and tableware type stuff. They have every color imaginable to fit any theme or decor style.",neutral

"Had dinner here last night. Ordered the #35 and my husband got his usual pork nachos. The food is great! The servings tho are much smaller than the Don Juan restaurant downtown on Main Street. The customers are completely different. They cater more to the white retired/upper class people. Which is okay, it's just different vibe than original location. I'd rather drive the extra mile to downtown restaurant for serving sizes and the diversity of customers. Plus the waiters at summerlin location check on you every 10 minutes, but it feels as if it's every 5. Where as the other location doesn't check on you rarely at all. So that's a thumbs up to summerlin. Restaurant decor in summerlin is decorated to make upper class family feel more comfortable. Main St location is all Frida out and very authentic feel to it.",neutral
"ok so we see on tv and decide lets go. its Wednesday wing night lets try it out ... travel all the way there and wait for a table 15-20 min. right before they seat us we are informed they don't have any more wings. REALLY !!  so since we waited already we didn't just walk out like others did that waited only to be told ""sorry we ran out"" that's when we noticed how dirty the tile floor was and then how black and nasty the carpet was. is this any indication of how they clean the rest of the place. sure all the tvs are nice sure they apologized and even gave us a card for 12 wings but didn't help much. so ordered nachos, skins a sandwich w/fries expected larger portions for the prices fresh cut fries were not cooked enough the skins were really good and the nachos were average as well as the very tiny chicken sandwich that was like something from a cafeteria. no I would never tell someone to go to a place this filthy even if they have good food. if you like dirty bars that serve mediocre bar food then you hit the jackpot here. servers and staff were nice but not great. and my appetizers came out AFTER MY SANDWICH even though I asked for them to come out first as APPETIZERS. get it together people is it really that hard. sorry new day cle. but can you recommend a place that's not a hole or a dive. thanks",neutral

You can get a ton of goodies here for $20- but my favorite purchase are the cheese burekas, packed 2/$2, and stuffed with feta cheese.

Second time I've been here. First time with the boys. Like any Saturday night it was extremely busy. We had a party of 8 and were seated within 30 minutes. The service was slow but very accommodating. They brought out the kids meals quickly but faltered on the adult's meals. We ended up leaving and having our meals packed to go because the kids were done 1.5 hours in. But I have to give credit to management. They took our entrees off the final bill. I was not expecting that whatsoever.   You have to try their lobster crab dip appetizer. It's really good.   I had their Brie Burger. Very good combination of fixings and Brie cheese. I recommend it.   I would come back again.,neutral

"We ventured here during a trip to Montreal because Fairmount bagels are a thing and when we travel, we have to try all of the things. Fairmount bakery is a small bakery. Only a few people can wait inside and the rest outside, regardless of weather obviously. You order at the counter and there's no place to sit inside or even eat inside standing. You have to take them to go and find somewhere to eat them. It's also even difficult to find benches outside in the area to eat the bagels. You can purchase a single serving of Philadelphia cream cheese to go with the bagels if you'd like. They won't slice or toast the bagels for you. This place is mostly a to go bagel shop for people who are buying dozens of bagels. Just be prepared for this before you go. I got the garlic bagel. Honestly, the garlic was a bit burnt and the bagel was hard on the outside with a chewy inside. This is how Montreal bagels are suppose to taste but I just don't think I like Montreal bagels!

"My husband and I were driving around near our house looking for a place to have breakfast early on a Sunday morning. We chanced upon Postino as one of the few places open before 10am on Sun.  I'm glad we found the place.  I ordered the scrambled eggs with salad and tomatoes and my husband had the ciabatta french toast.  Both of our dishes were fantastic, though portions were smallish but overall decent value for the price/quality.  Our coffee and mimosa were great too--mimosa way more champagne than OJ as it should be. My complaint here was with the service.  I didn't realize that the restaurant's specialty is bruschetta and that they also serve the full menu on Sunday morning; nor did I realize that if you want bread with your breakfast you need to order bruschetta.  Our waiter never said a thing.  He seemed more interested in ""looking the part"" and I had to ask that he take our order at one point after we'd both been seated more than 10 minutes at a non-busy time. To top it all off, when we asked for the check, I was handed a bill padded with an extra drink and breakfast item--really, really BAD. I do see a return trip here, however, as the food is really, really well prepared from very fresh-tasting ingredients.  But WATCH THE BILL HERE, KEEP TRACK OF WHAT YOU ORDER.",neutral

"After a meh visit at the Scottsdale Quarter location, we received a coupon for BOGO free through their rewards app. We decided to visit this location and give it a try since we were in the area. When we walked in, the first thing we noticed was how packed it was. Did everyone come for the coupon? There was probably around 20 or more people waiting to get their ice cream.   The workers did yell out to please be patient a few times as they are working as fast as they could. We sat down and waited... And waited... Then we stood and waited... and waited...the whole time watching.  I understand that the ice cream is made to order, but the process was not efficient at all. There were times that no ice cream was being made/churned. The workers were all working hard, but if there is a promo going on, you would think that they would staff it better?  So, after 45 minutes, we finally got our ice cream.  Thankfully it was made well/correctly and tasted good.     Overall, after 2 sub par visits (here and the Scottsdale Quarter) and 2 good visits (Scottsdale Waterfront and Uptown), they are batting at .500... Which isn't very good for an ice cream shop.  I'm not sure how often we will make it a point to go since it is kinda pricey and a 50-50 chance of it being a good experience",neutral

"The Rampart Casino is a-ok. It's mostly a local retirement home (you'll never see as many oxygen tanks and walkers as you will here) and a great place for grandma and grandpa to go and spend their grandkids' inheritance on penny slot machines. It's fun to count the number of walking canes here.   The casino floor is situated in a big circle so it's hard to get lost on the floor. It's spacious but can get very smoky and crowded on busy nights.   They have a good selection of slot machines and games (mostly pennies) and a few table games that cater to the golfers or convention goers staying at the attached hotel.   Join the player's club for free and you'll get monthly mailers with offers in the mail (if you play a little bit, you can expect free slot play coupons and coupons for a free buffet). The Rampart also runs promotions for free trinkets (t-shirts, waffle irons, etc.).   The restaurants are pretty bad, the coffee shop and pub are the only decent options. Stay far away from the Carmel Room and the buffet!",neutral

"Lunch for 4.  - Ambiance (3/5) A little jenky, a little eclectic.    - Service (4/5) Courteous and fast.  - Exotic Mushroom Stir Fry, $15 (3/5) Great mix of mushrooms, though the cream sauce was a bit heavy.  The polenta was pretty good, though the tomato and avocado seemed a tad out of place.    - Value (2/5) Wasn't a fan of the portion size of the mushroom dish.  It kind of felt like there was just 1 of each kind of mushroom.  Certainly not ""mucho mushrooms"" as it says on the menu.  - Final Word The chopped salad my friend got looked delicious.

"My gf introduced me to Roberto's, and if she hadn't, there's an excellent chance I would've missed Roberto's altogether.  It's un-remarkably decorated to the point of almost drab inside and out, at least the location I patronize, but clearly Roberto knows he doesn't need to spend money on the ambiance since people flock there to eat.  I don't really know authentic Mexican food, and I tend to go for the ala cart items like a simple regular taco, but I can judge a good place by the line at the counter that's there no matter what time of day (and Roberto's is open 24/7).  Because of hours of business, the place can sometimes draw an odd crowd.  If I were hungover, second only to Waffle House, I'd go for Roberto's at 3AM, but that's another story for another kind of forum.    My gf gets the #11 every time.  I don't know what all is in that, but she never deviates from that item.  She piles on the carrots from the condiment bar, too.  She loves Roberto's and that's really why I continue to spend money at this place because the food in terms of flavor, doesn't really stand out to me, but I can tell a real difference in Roberto's dishes compared to other fast food Mexican joints.  It's fresh, for starters.  And for fresh, they prepare it made-to-order every time and quickly.  If the crowd at Roberto's is unruly, at least I don't have to hang around there too long.",neutral

"Came here for the XX time since Bellagio opened recently on Sunday for dinner. I used to come a decent amount when Bellagio first opened but I haven't been here for at least 5-10 years. When Bellagio first opened, i remember how strict they were with not allowing anyone under the age of 21 to enter the hotel. But also, at that same time, Bellagio's buffet was the top buffet in the city offering huge king crab legs, kobe beef, and some other things. I was way too young at that point to really appreciate the quality/quantity but i do remember how it used to be.   We had heard that the buffet had made some changes and improved (from a frequent customer), as well as bring a few popular dishes from a few restaurants to be available at the buffet as well.   - Lago by Julian Serrano's Malloreddus Pasta with pork sausage and tomato sauce - Harvest by Roy Ellamar's chopped spinach salad with Blue Lizard Farm's bloomsdale spinach, bacon, blue cheese, asparagus and tomato vinaigrette - Noodles' chicken pad Thai with flat rice noodles, chicken, egg, peanuts, bean sprouts and onions - Todd English's Olives' Tuscan farmhouse flatbread with mozzarella cheese, shaved Smithfield ham, asparagus and caramelized onions.  Along with the top mentioned additions, they now offer hot snow crab and Dungeness crab daily as well as a caviar station offering Ikura (salmon row), American black caviar, and red tobiko.   After arrival, we paid and had been sat down pretty quickly. Decor still looks the same as it was before but they now have self-serve drink area near almost every seating area for guests to grab their own drinks, relieving a huge work load off the staff. Full customizable coke machine with juice machine, teas, and coffees.   I was excited to go grab food so i had loaded 3 plates on the first run. 1 plate consisted of hot snow crab. Another plate was crawfish boil and butter clams. Last plate was shrimp cocktail and prime rib.   Hot snow crab. This is one of the depressing things ive seen change over the years at not only this property but all others as well. They went from whole legs to split legs. Loses a lot of the natural crab flavor and juices while adding a whole ton of saltiness from the salted water used to cook the crab. And apparently, this was already LESS salty than the cold crab ! everyone gonna walk out with elevated blood pressure due to the massive amount of salt intake from just crabs... Near the end of our meal, they changed the legs to whole legs. These legs looked much larger but what the crap?! THESE WERE MORE SALTY ! how they were able to attain this result, i have no idea. Despite this, im sure i still had 4 plates worth... They were kind of anal on how much they give. You ask for plate to be filled, they give you a ""covered plate"" of like 7 - 10 scrawny lookin legs until you ask for more.   Crawfish. Tiny baby crawfish overcooked and drying up on the buffet line. Unlike a lot of other places that keep the crawfish in soup/broth/water, this seems like its on a hot plate steaming in its own juices, or whats left of it.   Clams were decent. The creamy butter sauce was nice. Good for dipping crab in too.   As mentioned before, they had a caviar station. Ikura was ok, not as fresh as it should be. Mildly deflated pearls of salmon eggs. Red tobiko is the ""firmest"" of the 3 with a mild salty flavor. The american black caviar was pretty decent. Soft pearls of caviar, lightly salted. Unfortunately, im not too much of a fan of the pancakes they put the caviar on because they were soft and made it weird Lol. I just ate the eggs off and left its vehicle.   No rack of lamb as some of us had hoped for but they had leg of lamb, which was fairly decent. Juicy, tender, and flavorful. WAY better than the ""prime rib"" which was overcooked and dry.   The Julian Serrano's Malloreddus Pasta with pork sausage and tomato sauce was pretty decent. Never had screw type pasta that big which became a good vessle for carrying the sauce.   Some other things i tried include grilled asparagus, pesto mashed potatoes, paella which were all pretty decent  Desserts, they had a good amount of selection. I had a few creme brulee's which were made really well. Super smooth and creamy but not too sweet (i take off the carmelized layer...) Had 2 of these in addition to a creamy smooth cheesecake, key lime tart, lemon meringue tart, various macarons where my friends and I tried to guess the flavor  Service, like mentioned before, the waitress had its load reduced as guests gets their own drinks, was amazing. She was really attentive and had our plates cleared fast ! ! She even cleared our shell plates and brought em back so we constantly had extra plates for shells ! Nice !!  Overall, I mean its decent but maybe not for the price. At a discounted offer currently due to employee pricing, I still feel for the quality you are getting, its still a bit overpaid. I really wish they could return to previous quality, even if less variety is offered",neutral

"Average breakfast, tourist restaurant in front of the Bellagio fountain.  It's got a very nice patio seating area with heaters for winter.  I ordered the smoked salmon benedict and the bun was way too hard that I couldn't cut through with my knife.  My wife ordered the French toast, it's not too bad but nothing extraordinary.  Like I said, if you want a breakfast that's more finer than Denny's than give it a try, if it's not too hot make sure you ask for patio seat.  Although I believe they have mists running outside during hot summer heat.  My opinion above is solely based on breakfast and I know they offer many other choices for lunch and dinner.

I ordered the corn-beef hash, which was quite good... actually saving the rating for this place a bit.  I could tell all the food was prepared well.  The service also saved the rating a bit.

Typically as a guest you'd expect a warm hello, but usually I'm not even greeted with eye contact. Very off-putting. Also, there seems to be a general disregard for the mirrored yoga room.

"We've returned two years later, and I wasn't as WOWed.   First of all, their texting waiting system? They don't tell you that it takes another hour PAST the waiting time printed on your ticket for you to be seated. My ticket time said ""742pm"", which was literally 5 hours later, but we figured it was still fine and gave us time to still get ready before going out.   I get my text around 730 saying to head over to the podium. We get there, and are told to stand in the line just to pay. From the time we stood in line to the time we got seated, it was another extra hour. I feel like they should tell you this on the printed ticket, because it falsely makes you believe that you'll get in at a certain time. I was pretty annoyed by the time we sat.  The goods: Crab legs- they have them hot and cold, and if you ask the guy behind the table, he'll hand pick some good legs for you Nachos- love the nachos in the small saucer Baked potato- like the small size with cheese, bacon, and sour cream Mushroom truffle soup- pretty good flavor. One of the better soups I've had at a buffet Dessert crepe- you tell them what you want inside for the sauce, and top it with fruit and whipped cream. Delish  The bads: Asian food- yes, they have a large selection, but it's not good quality or that tasty. Their har gow was super mushy and not good Italian- total lack of italian food. Their pizza is lackluster and the only pasta they had was gemelli. Super mushy and overcooked  Crab ravioli- not good. Smelled fishy and the insides were so gross, I actually spit it out Prime rib- I didn't have any, but hubby and his cousin said it was tough and didn't taste good, and the cut was too small  I also was looking forward to some sweet potato tots and there were NONE! Very disappointed.   I don't remember bacchanal being like this when I went when they first opened, I feel like the quality has gone down. The wait all afternoon and night was not worth it, and if the wait was ever this long again, I wouldn't do it. I'd rather go to Wynn or Wicked Spoon.",neutral

"I came to Steamers once before for a job, and I told myself if I ever needed to watch a game this is where I'm coming. This place is right around the corner from my house and well, lets say they have a lot of TV's. It's a sports pub, I didn't expect less. So I came here to watch the Knicks play because of an Asian American player Jeremy Lin play and I didn't receive the game at home.  I ate the Philly Cheese Steak. The waiter came and asked me if I wanted tomatoes and lettuce, and I did however when they came back they didn't have tomatoes and lettuce and they brought it out on a plate instead. The tomatoes were fine, but the lettuce looked a little old. I drank a couple of beers and watched the game. The place had some pretty good 90's music and a good amount of country.   My roommate who went with me ordered a burger and said it was juicy and well cooked, so I can't really comment on what his thoughts were. (However, he does have the credentials because he's a student at Johnson and Wales and works in a kitchen) After we ate our entree, we ordered the nacho supreme. It wasn't bad. the lettuce still wasn't that fresh, but the portion size was okay. At 10 every weekend they have karaoke night.  Overall, if I come back here, I would just order a beer watch the game (as they had so many TV's just ask what you want to watch and they'll get your own TV) and then go home. Maybe get some nachos as it's not expensive at all. I don't know what the first reviewer was talking about with the prices were expensive. I didn't think it was expensive at all, but actually not priced badly at all.",neutral

"You know what they say about location, location, location?  Well this place is in a horrible location to say the very least.   I was extremely nervous to leave my car in the parking lot & while walking to the restaurant a bum rode up on his bicycle and asked us for money. Sketchy!  But we kept on because of the glowing reviews.  Also, there's a swingers club in the same strip mall....gives new meaning to strip mall. the inside decor of the restaurant leaves much to be desired as well. This is not a 'date place' in terms of dressing up.  Jeans are protocol here.  They also don't take reservations, which doesn't score any points with me.  Our waitress barely spoke English to the point where another one of the waiters had to assist with our table.  She also asked us if we liked cats????????????? Now when eating in an Asian restaurant we both thought this was extremely weird. Apparently, she had found a mother cat with babies and was trying to find them homes?????? At least that's what we hope.  Food was pretty good, I wouldn't' say it's the best Thai food I've ever had, Sakun Thai is closer to me and just as good.  I'm going to go back and try it again in case there's something I missed. Stay tuned.",neutral
"This place isn't bad at all. It's fairly new in the neighborhood and actually checked it out by accident considering the restaurant I wanted to go to around the corner was way overpriced. I'm glad I stopped by to check it out! The menu was fairly reasonable, and yea, it did remind me of Chipotle, except, I think this place has larger burritos than Chipotle! The staff was friendly, and fast. They put our burritos in this oven conveyor belt that thoroughly melted the cheese and baked our burritos. I would definitely come back again.",neutral

"This little sushi spot located in Village Square used to be 808 Tapas...from the get go, the place is small but familiarly cozy. Nothing too special or out of the ordinary in decor, but a little on the modern side without getting too contemporary. Upon entering...greetings by staff welcome you like most Japanese places. All seem to be nice and helpful. Food wise, the sushi portion to rice ratio is a little off, sometimes more rice than other sushi restaurants. Food taste is pretty good to mediyoker depending on what you order.  This place doesn't seem to get overly packed, but it's a decent enough place to go to if you are craving sushi and in the area. Look for Yelp check in to unlock offers like sake. They also have specials going on on social media so be sure to check it out or ask to save on price.  Would I come back? Probably, but as a back up. Nice place to try though...you may have a different experience.",neutral
"Walking into BT's Burgerjoint, one is immediately greeted by the laid back vibe of a beachfront burger bar. Blue walls adorned with surfboards, naked light bulbs strung from posts, and a mix of Carolina and California beach music drifts from the speakers welcoming customers.  Ordering is made easy by following the directions on the menu boards. Choose an award winning burger, hot dog or chicken, then dress it up with cheese, bacon and toppings of your choice. Several salad options are also available; though the Grilled Chicken Salad proved to be bland, and the Ranch dressing was clearly not housemade.   It is the Hand-Cut Sweet Potato Fries drizzled with Honey Butter that deserve a special mention, though. Warm, tender and salty sweet potato fingers lightly fried and complemented by the sticky sweet Honey Butter induce fried tater euphoria for fry connoisseurs and novices alike. If you are dedicated to their regular hand cut fries, try a Half And Half for the best of both.  Service and wait times are inconsistent at BT's. Long lines at lunch are unacceptable for those on a limited lunch hour or who are attempting to appease the hungry preschool set. However, when the staff isn't slammed, they are attentive and kind.   BT's Burgerjoint is located at 14130 Rivergate Parkway in Charlotte and can be reached at 704-494-7356.",neutral

"This was my husband's second visit and my first to Dragon Palace.  The first time my husband went he came home excited about having a good Chinese place so close to us (and let me clarify that we are both American born Chinese so we love greasy Chinese food).    I love that right after we sit down they bring the tea, and there's no extra charge like a lot of Chinese restaurants these days.  This place does offer a great deal for a LOT of food -- we went with the Family Dinner special which was 11.95 a person for soup, eggroll, fried wontons, pork chow mein, fried rice, and sweet and sour pork.  By the time the entrees came around we were totally full and we ended up taking three full cartons of food home.  The service was prompt, attentive, and very friendly.    However, I thought that the food here was very difficult to eat.  The chow mein especially was really, really salty.  I never ever send food back but we had to ask for them to cook it again because it was so salty, and it wasn't much better after that.  The sweet and sour pork was deep fried pork with sweet and sour sauce drizzled over it -- not even coated evenly.  The meat itself was tough and chewy in texture.  The fried rice was decent, nothing extraordinary.  My favorite part of the meal was the dessert, they make these fried bananas wrapped in wontons that are coated with honey and they are delicious!  Since my husband had such a positive experience the first time he went, I am willing to give this place another try.  Maybe they just hired a new chef (our server said that he was also brand new) so there may be some inconsistencies in the menu.",neutral

"Summary: simple takeout spot has some of the best chicken sandwiches and coco bread I've ever tried, but wait times can get long, and the other dishes are not as mouth-wateringly delicious  Top Must-Get: chicken sandwich Top Regret: jerk pork  Located right beside KFC and down the road from Popeye's - it says a lot that this small takeout place still gets lineups for its chicken. It's a cramped space - you sort of just bunch up in the best line you can make when it's busy, and then order at the window. It can be a long wait since it's a small shop, but during down times, it's fairly efficient.  Their chicken sandwich meat is stripped right off the leg of a chicken, and it is absurdly tender and tasty. I get it without the coleslaw so that nothing detracts from the juicy chicken taste, properly flavoured, as I bite into it. Delicious.  They also have superior coco bread than other local Jamaican places - it's got a tinge of sweetness that just tickles the tastebuds right, and it's noticably less dry than others.  However, their jerk pork is missing the same legendary calling of their chicken. I also think their patties are comparable to supermarket-bought ones, so they aren't necessarily amazing (although not bad either - I have had the patty in coco bread a few times!)  The other dishes are decent if not spectacular. I recall feeling a bit let down at their dinner portions: a hefty amount of rice, but not a proportionate amount of meat.  That said, it's worth a visit if only for their chicken sandwich.",neutral

"I went here with some friends a couple weeks ago at about 830 pm. It was great. I asked the server what he would recommend to me and he said the Pad Thai with chicken.

I ordered the Pad Thai again, but I was not happy with the server we had. She took forever to get our drinks and was not the friendliest. She also took my husbands soda while we were eating to refill it and took forever to bring it back. It was not even empty yet. I like the Pad Thai, but there is nothing else very appetizing on the menu for me. I would come back for the Pad Thai.",neutral
"So I was at work and my co-worker recommended that I try their poutine because it was a pretty big portion size and she said it tasted good.  I walked in and it was pretty dead for a Saturday afternoon, but then again I don't expect it to be busy during the day.  It was nicely decorated with chandeliers, paintings and had big comfy lounge chairs.  I ordered take-out and went with their ""Sweet Quebecer"" which is a poutine with sweet potato fries, gravy and cheese curds.  It was something different so I decided, why not?  It came to $9 and I waited about ten minutes for my food, which wasn't too long.  I got back to work and opened up the take-out container and I was mildly disappointed by the portion size.  It was much smaller than I had imagined for the price I paid.  Overall, the taste of the poutine was mediocre.  Nothing special even with the sweet potato fries.  I'd probably be better off going somewhere else and paying that much for a better tasting poutine.",neutral

The problem is that I need to be moved in a positive or negative way to get inspired enough to write a review, and I haven't had a moving dining experience in quite some time!  This place has all the makings of that needle in a haystack restaurant you find when exploring a city. And while I enjoyed the authenticity of Forgotten Taste Pierogies, complete with counter service and carry out only dishes, the food was just good, not great. I don't confess to be a Pierogi expert by any means, but my limited experience with Pierogies in the past painted a much better memory than the Pierogies I had today. They were good enough to eat, but a lot more bland than the ones I've had elsewhere. The stuffed cabbage also has a bland meat filling and was topped with a very basic tomato sauce. The highlight for me was the Haluski, which was an afterthought to me in the combo I ordered. The Haluski had a crunch with the Cabbage & Onions and was topped with a smooth, buttery sauce that combined perfectly with the tender Bowtie pasta.  Overall, I would recommend this place, but next time I come back, I'm going to try their more unique Pierogi of the day and a couple different dishes (like the Goulash!).",neutral

The food and pizza are very good. Most of all the salads. I really love the bread they use for the sandwiches. It's that big soft bun that just soaks up the sauce or what ever you have on it. The salads are never skimpy and full of flavor. I really love the ranch they use.  It's a place you always have to order way ahead of time because it's almost never ready when they say it is. Now you could say it's because they are busy and yes most of the time they are but when they say 20min they mean 35 or 40. But you don't want to show up late because if your food is ready you don't want it getting cold. I would give this place a 5 or 4 and of ordered more from them if they did not have that issue. It's just this issue. But the food is so good I went back so its worth a shot. Just remember the times issue when you order.,neutral

If I were a zoo animal, I'd be hiding from the zoolights too, so I can't really blame the animals.   We followed the pathways, which are clearly marked for the event, and only deviated once when Mark H. had to purchase a coffee. Actually, that place was definitely on the designated pathways. I also believe the gift shop was too.   Thumbs up for the ability to purchase the tickets online and then just showing the tickets on my phone! No paper wasted, just the green paper for admission.

I wasn't very impressed with the tempeh sandwich. I don't know whether they don't know what chimichurri is or there was a mistake in the kitchen but my sandwich had pesto instead of chimichurri. That I didn't really mind but still the sandwich wasn't anything memorable and was very bland. The taco was ok and burger looked ok (I didn't try it).   I found the food and drinks to be way over-priced. They charge $13 for a mediocre sandwich and additional $4-5 for any sides such as fries. I had a glass of red wine which costed $13 for 5oz but it looked more like 3oz to me.   Overall I wasn't really impressed by Taylor's Landing even though I had very high hopes for it. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.   Food: 3.5/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Prices: 3/5 Overall: 3.5/5",neutral
"If you have a big appetite, Big Heng does not disappoint. The portions indeed are huge. The Yelp reviews here were accurate. I have never been an Egg Drop Soup fan, but because of my daughter's love for this American Chinese creation and the reviews on the soup here, I decided to try the place out. Once again, it did not disappoint. I like this soup so much that I will come back here to carry out this comfort food for sick family members. It was simply delicious. Don't forget to add pepper.  Tonight, we ordered the #1 Dinner Combo with Sweet and Sour Pork, Mooshu Pork Crepes, and Hunan Chicken. They portions are huge. The egg roll was standard American Chinese fare. The Crab Puff was tasty, little crab, lots of cream cheese. The lo mein had a lovely texture, but lacked distinction. The fried rice was okay. The Sweet and Sour Pork had too much batter and the sauce was a dousing of the store bought sauce that they serve with the egg roll. Because of the photographs, I thought the Mooshu Pork would taste more like Peking Duck. The crepe was authentic and so was the sauce that it came with. The filling however was a salty stir-fry of scallions, bean sprouts, fried egg and strips of non-descript pork. Finally, the Hunan Chicken had great ingredients but the gravy was overwhelmingly soya sauce and corn starch. They honored my request for no MSG or Monosodium Glutamate  The servers were fantastic, mostly Cantonese speakers. I felt like I was back in Hong Kong. They were friendly and helpful. When I requested to go boxes, they insisted on packing it up for me. They give me tips on where to get good dim sum. I really wanted to rate Big Heng higher. The service and soup was 5 stars. The rest of the main dishes were on a 2-3 star level. Hence, the 3 star rating. I will definitely return for the Egg Drop Soup.",neutral

The coleslaw was very good.  My friend the roti with curry chicken.  The flavour was there, but there was a lot bones which is not traditionally roti.  That was disappointing.    Overall it is an ok place, just need to work on the little things.  One thing is true, from one Yelper in other reviews to myself they need to take out the bones.

"The service was outstanding; I appreciated the staff members, who were clearly well trained, and must be treated well enough to be content with their work. Kudos to them, and the management.  The food was somewhat disappointing - not terrible, but not great either. I had roasted Brussels sprouts, which were fine, and calamari, which was brought to the table just warm (deep-fried foods should always be piping hot), and dressed in an overwhelming sauce - not the subtle sort of flavoring or careful preparation I hoped for.   Additionally, it was very loud in the dining room. Our server stated that it was due to all the windows being closed. The view of the fountains is a nice feature of the place. Perhaps it is a place to visit in the summer.   Finally, I question the $$ rating - it at least borders on, if not qualifies for, $$$.",neutral
"I'm thinking more of a 3.5 for this place. Let's start with a negative, the parking is usually a nightmare. The narrow strip of parking spots doesn't accommodate everybody when it's a Friday night.

The food is good, and all at a very reasonable cost. Queso dip is always a great way to start, along with the margaritas. Both always tasty and delightful! Strawberry frozen is my recommendation :) The food has usually been good for me and the waitstaff is always pretty quick with service. I usually get chicken quesadilla with queso cheese, yum! When I order take out, they always pack plenty of rice. If you're craving Mexican, this is a great place to go.",neutral

"Three stars is actually quite the win for Bata considering the low expectations that i went in with, and speaks highly to Bata's credibility as a museum, even when the customer doesn't much of an interest in the subject matter (in my case, my significant other was very much looking forward to it, and probably would give it a 4-5 star review if she was authoring this review).  The most interesting segment for me was the history of the shoe, although i would have appreciated a bit more of a linear narrative - i struggled to tie some of the areas into the greater history.    The exhibit on the dangers of shoes and fashion throughout the years (arsenic dyes, anyone) was also fairly engaging.  Wish we could have seen it during the 'pay what you choose' night, as i did think the price was a bit on the high side given the size of the museum.  I believe there is a deal where you can also gain admission to the textile and a third museum for a small amount more, but neither of the other two interested us.",neutral

Nearly 3 weeks later after a couple email communications I was informed I would be receiving a refund because they couldn't find K67. I was very mad and losing my patience by this time. I ended up going back to the store and buying a basic model K45 which was in stock from the begining. Instead of getting a refund they processed it as an even exchange which helped.,neutral

Then after another 50 minutes, the food arrived. Not a huge order. 2 karahis, naan and tawwa keema. The tawwa keema was a complete flop. Keema was chunky and tasteless. No sign of smoke flavour. Karahi was good. But not the same taste as their original location. Something is different. However, it is still good. But it is not worth the wait. There were only 2 or 3 servers. It's 7-8 times bigger in size, but still the same number of people serve. But unfortunately it's not their fault. They can serve only what's cooked and provided. To wait almost an hour for 2 karahis is ridiculous. Won't be coming back. Either I'm going to old location or finding another place for my karahi fix.",neutral

One, they are very greasy, so much so that the two burgers I've had here have actually been sitting in a small pool of grease, leading my bun and some fries to become soggy. This could perhaps be mitigated by asking for your burger to be cooked slightly longer, something I will ask for when I go back. Two, I am always disappointed when higher end burger joints opt for processed cheese slices; at least have an option for real cheese! This is a debate between burger lovers that will never be settled, some people prefer processed cheese, but I think there should always be an option if a burger joint wants to be considered a quality shop. It's the same issue I have with Five Guys and Burger Priest...",neutral
"The service has always been great at SOHO. The food has been good and prices definitely adjusted to the fancy car driving clientele of the neighborhood. It could end up being a pretty expensive dinner for food that is usually not marked up this high. Biscuits are brought out before the meal and they are delicious. Like Shock G said on The Humpty Dance ""Just grab 'em in the biscuits."" The chicken and waffles are good but could be had down the street at XYZ for $4 cheaper and taste just about the same. Anything with country ham on the menu is worth ordering. Most  items are calorie laden but if you want to try to eat something nutritionally decent, the harvest moon salad is a good lunch option. There are a couple of interesting parallels with that dish and Neil Young. Of course the song title and also his mention of country ham in the song Albuquerque. I most enjoyed the chicken-fried pork salad at lunch that has deviled eggs, avocado, bacon, corn, tomato and Green Goddess dressing.  The hush puppies are a great appetizer to share.

"I came here a couple of times already. I wanted to give them a second chance or third chance, I thought. Anyway, everything wasn't the same as the first time I came. I had a chance to join in their soft opening event with Yelp. Thanks to the Restaurant and Yelp for the great event. It was a blast.  Pressed sushi was incredible.  The dessert, Pina Cotta was unforgettable. The event made me wanted to come back again, and I did. The second time I came with my Yelp friends. We missed their food badly. We ordered a bunch of everything, sushi, sashimi, pressed sushi, tempuras, and dessert. Their service was somewhat slow. They were very busy at the time. But the portion of food was smaller than the first time we came. It was fine for me. I still believed that they just opened and didn't expect many customers in the first few months. So I gave them another chance and came back again. It was last week. This time, it was only my friend and me. She wanted to eat Japanese food, so I recommend her this restaurant. I told her Kaka is well known and I was sure she liked it.   I think my expectation was too high. Our sashimi and other dishes were very tiny.  The worst was salmon sashimi size and sushi rolls. I know that I can order more and more, but I prefer the bigger portion anyway.  It was too tiny and didn't look nice.  The Pina Cotta jelly was bland. The tempuras were difficult to chew. The only thing I like was ""TAKO WASABI"" But I couldn't order the only thing here. I came for all you can eat! I'm sure they can do better than this. Hopefully!

"I've had a take out menu on my fridge for this place for two years at least but I never ordered from them because I'm lazy and I generally only order from a place if I can order online.  Anything to avoid that whole talking-to-a-real-person thing.  Anytime I try a new Chinese place I order all of my favorites at once just so I know if it's worth a second time around.  There were some highs and lows and in-betweens.  1. Wonton Egg Drop Soup - Nothing on any Chinese menu will ever be better than putting the two best soups in the world together.... unless you get it from Gold Chef.  I'm glad I only ordered the small because I didn't even finish that.  The wontons were fine, but the broth was so bland.  It was basically just egg water... I want you to sit and think about what egg water might taste like... you got a lock down in your mind on that? That's right.  Egg water.  It was really, really horrible.  Zero stars for the soup.  2.  Crab Puffs - These were fine.  Not any detectable crab, but they weren't over sweet like so many tend to be.  I would order these again.    3.  Egg Rolls - A few people mentioned that there is no meat in these, but there most certainly was a noticeable amount of pork in mine.  So please, if you are a vegetarian or do not eat pork, this is NOT something you want to order.  Do not listen to the other reviews who say it's all vegetable.  That all being said, they are tasty.  Sufficiently crispy and flavorful with a good ratio of wrapper to filling.  4. Lemon Chicken - The chicken is breaded, not battered, which is a plus in my book.  The lemon sauce was also probably the best lemon sauce I've ever had.  I'm not sure everyone would agree, though.  It's very sweet and tastes almost like a lemon glaze for pies rather than something for a savory dish, but I thought it tasted awesome with the chicken.  This is gonna be a judgment call on if you think you'd like a sweeter sauce.  The chicken itself wasn't as dry as the breaded chicken tends to be in other places, so that was a bonus as well.  5. Singapore Mei Fun - No one ever has and probably ever will beat the PF Changs version of this dish (Singapore Street Noodles) but this one was decent.  The chicken and pork seemed a little dry and not very fresh, but the flavor was fine and the shrimp was cooked well.  I might have liked it just a touch spicier though.  Overall, everything was very good, but I just couldn't bring myself to give a 4 star rating because the soup was just THAT BAD.  The only way I'd order again is if I had a craving for something specific and didn't really want soup.  Sadly, I usually only order Chinese food when I have a soup craving specifically.  Such a shame that the most important component for me was the one horrible thing I got.",neutral

"I am kind of surprised that parties of two got seated quickly! I was there on a Thursday at noon, and the wait was roughly 40-50 minutes. We got seated when it was out turn. It was chilly outside, so one of the servers brought out some mint tea in disposable cups. How nice!   Ordered the Cairo classic and mind blowing chicken. The portions were big, and the prices were fair. But... never have I ever seen a brunch spot charge for drip coffee by size. And it didn't  seem like there  was significant difference between the small and medium. And to top it off, I didn't love the coffee.   The food was very good! Everything was spicy - not heat, but bold flavours. That's what differentiates Maha's from most brunch spots. As most people mentioned, it did take a while for the food to come out, which doesn't help the table turnover at such a busy restaurant. We had the window seat, and I actually ate quickly because I felt very self conscious about the line of people watching me ""take my time"". It's in my head, but still, faster service would have made it better.   Do I think it's worth the 40-50 minute wait... maybe on a nice day with good company... or when they have the patio open, so turnover is faster. I do recommend you try it out at least once!",neutral

A bit pricey for what you get. (Ordered a club sandwich and my girlfriend got a sandwich along with a pomegranate drink and a coffee iced drink she got) all for just under $30.",neutral

Most of the other items ranged from average to good, but not much else was spectacular. I've heard that this buffet has gone downhill in recent years, but I have no basis for comparison.",neutral

Most were very friendly but the manager running it was actually very mean. Nothing like going somewhere and being made to feel like an idiot. That's the only reason I'm giving 3 stars.

"I normally come through the drive-thru during the day and the service is normally really good. They're quick and are always greeting you with a smile and making sure they have your order right. One thing they advertise is the face-to-face interaction when making your order. Unfortunately, most of the time I go through with someone or with a big order, by the time we get to the window, we've forgotten our order! It would be nice if there was a smaller menu of some sort next to the order window for those of us who forget our order!  I went through the drive-thru last night and it took me forever! We drove past the first two windows, which was understandable since it was late at night. I figured maybe they just didn't have enough people. The cook took my order! Someone else came to ring me up and the cook washed her hands and went towards the back again, but it's like, seriously? They shouldn't be THAT short-staffed! Then, I was waiting for my order at the second window, and they looked like they were either cleaning out the area or restocking since the tea containers were in the middle of the floor. One of the workers was wiping down the area then went towards the back. When he left, I noticed there was some cashier/front worker (whatever you call those guys) just standing around eating a slurpee. He looked at me, looked away, and then gave himself some more of the slurpee looking thing and kept on at it. Not working at all. Meanwhile, the manager comes by to refill the cups. Why is she doing what he was supposed to be doing? If you're on break, it's understandable, but at least go out of sight so you don't make yourself look bad!

"I would say that this hotel has some real highlights and some big misses as well.  Let's start with what is good--The M Lounge is great--they have soy milk available all the time--which I like.  Their breakfast is one of the best ever at Marriott Lounges--great omelette bar.  The lounge has a nice layout in terms of space and there is room to work--which is great because the rooms have no desks--very strange.  I travel mostly for business so a workspace is important to me.  They have good cardio equipment--hardly any strength training equipment though.  The hotel has been nicely refurbished and everything looks fresh.  Now the low lights....I checked in late due to delayed flights and when I got to the hotel I did not have an upgraded room--though I was told it was--it was just a standard room--and what's more the air conditioning did not work at all--no fan, no cool air--nothing.  WHen I called down I was told it would be over 30 minutes to get someone to come look at it--really??? it's nearly 1 am.  what exactly are they doing at that hour?  Any way, after much back and forth, I was given another room--actually a much better room, which I was told initially was not available--I guess if it's 1:30 in the morning and you were given a room with no AC---things suddenly just open up.  I am lifetime platinum elite with Marriott--why wouldn't someone have checked the room prior to my arrival to make sure everything was working?    Follow-thru is such a simple concept.  BTW yelpers--in many properties the fact that I am a lifetime platinum guest with Marriott makes no difference whatsoever, so don't be fooled by these hotel programs--most of the time they mean very little to nothing in terms of guest experience, with the exception of Hilton.  I am only gold status with them and they treat me like I am very special--every time I check in--and I get incredible rooms.  I would say that Hilton guest service for their premium guests is more evident than most Marriott hotels.    So I diverged--back to the Marriott in Calgary....I went to the restaurant for dinner--when traveling on business I want dinner in a timely manner and I like to receive the food as I ordered it--very simple expectations--neither was met at this hotel on Wednesday evening--I  ordered olives to start--the salmon with whipped potatoes instead of whatever came with it.  The olives came out pretty fast--I mean it was olives--how hard is that--then I waited, and I waited, and I waited, and I waited--25 minutes, 35 minutes, 45 minutes--where, pray tell, is the salmon?  I found my waiter eventually and it was coming right now...and I waited and it showed up--not as I ordered it--there were no whipped potatoes as I had specifically requested.  Then I waited and waited and the waiter shows up with boiled potatoes sort of smashed with milk--then he explains these are their mashed potatoes--however, I ordered the whipped potatoes--which by the way never came.  Anyway I had waited so long, I just had the meal packed up to go--no whipped potatoes. How hard is it to take a single dinner order and serve a meal in a timely fashion, correctly--apparently impossible--because it did not happen.  The waiter explained to me that that he had just forgotten about me because he was busy with a larger party and he was new--here is a clue for you Daniel--sometimes business travelers are there by themselves because they are working, and they want a meal.  I was then told it took such a long time for my meal because I ordered an appetizer--it was olives--you don't cook them--you put them in a container and deliver them to the table--people eat a few and then they want their meal--what in the world would make you think it would take me nearly an hour to eat 4 olives???? This property underperforms its potential in terms of service, but it is a good location, and the room was clean, and it has a good lounge.",neutral

"Pullano's is a dirty little sports bar located in a run down strip mall. But, remember, looks can be deceiving.   The pizza and wings are some of the best on the westside as well as some of the cheapest. But what really matters is Pullano's happy hour.   They have free pizza in the bar until 6pm everyday. On a side note, the way the pizza is set out makes it pretty unsanitary but since it's free...  Their drink specials are also pretty good. I usually go for $2.50 margaritas because they are decent tasting and cheap! I'm pretty sure the beer is really cheap as well, but I don't have any experience with drinking beer there.   The bar isn't bad at all, but the reason I give Pullano's three stars is because they really overcharged us during happy hour. We decided that getting drunk and stumbling across the street for night class at ASU West would be a decent idea. We preceded to have three margaritas each plus a gin and tonic and a Long Island Iced Tea. When our bill came out only the gin and tonic reflected the happy hour pricing. We were pretty upset, but we didn't have time to argue because we had to get to class.   Despite this bad experience, we continue to frequent Pullano's because the food is delicious. The specials are fantastic, as well.",neutral

"U of T Health Service is great...IF you know how to work the system. Hopefully I can provide some insight on how to navigate the health service with minimal pain.  FIRST appointment: is extremely difficult to make. Your best bet is to make one in person. Line up in the never-moving queue and register your student ID with Health Service. Ask for online registration, so that you never have to deal with them in person again.  If you call them, you will be put on hold for 10 minutes, and then the line will hang up on you. You will call them again, you will be put on hold for 10 minutes, and then the line will hang up on you. Lather, rinse, repeat, until a receptionist deigns your call worthy to answer.  SUBSEQUENT appointments: 15 minute (most) appts can be made online. Pick your doctor, pick your availability. If you need a longer appointment (first time birth control, STI tests, annual checkups), see ""first appointment"".  WHEN YOU ARRIVE at your appointment: Don't bother lining up in the never-moving queue. Just swipe your card at the self-check in and wait for the nurse to call.  DROP INs: Don't really exist. They're more like same-day appts. Visit the clinic as early in the day as possible. If you're lucky, they will give you a same-day appointment.  FLU SHOTS: Are super fast here and given by the nurses during designated flu shot clinic hours. However, make sure you ask for a fresh bandaid, because they peel the bandaids and stick them to the edge of various dirty tabletops to keep the super fast pace. Ew.  See? That was (reasonably) easy.",neutral

I would recommend coming here before they open to grab one of the 1st few numbers or coming closer to their 5 pm close time because they start speeding things up as it gets closer to 5 and especially after 5 because they all want to go home. I think I've seen 100 numbers called within 20 min! This location also has a snack bar so you can grab some refreshments without leaving and missing your turn.

Not the best quality, but these days unless you're going to a specialized spot, you kinda have to accept that.   The postal outlet upstairs, though, is always a disappointment.

While the chicken was super crispy, not oily, and juicy on the inside, it tasted overwhelmingly of maple and was missing the spicy kick I was expecting. Maybe there just wasn't enough of the spicy sauce?  The kimchi cheese fries were seasoned really well and the first few bites were great, until we got to the middle layer and realized there was no more gochujang mayo/kimchi/cheese for the rest of the fries. The remaining portion of fries was dry and we were sad that we had paid $7 for non-existent seasonings.  Probably would not return.",neutral

"I came here for happy hour with my coworkers last night. On Monday's they have 1/2 off bottles of wine until 7:30pm as well as $5-6 glasses of wine and discounted beer.   If you're interested in the $5-6 glasses of wine, many of them are already that price every day so don't feel like you're missing out and have to come during happy hour. There's TV screens so you can watch sports as well as a cigar shelf if you'd like to smoke.   I ordered the arancini (fine) while my coworker ordered the chapters salad (overloaded with shallots). I know it's a Tapas-type bar but I wish there was a portion of the menu with bigger entree-like items",neutral
"I am really surprised by all of the 4 and 5 star reviews. Did we eat at the same place? Don't get me wrong, some of the food was good. But I don't think it was $75 good. My friend Rachel and I came in for brunch on Sunday 2/21. You can find this place in a small shopping center where BFE meets Far as hell. (Horizon Ridge and Valle Verde). It was pretty busy, but we only waited about 30 minutes and then we were seated inside at a small table in the back. I would have preferred to have eaten outside because it was such a beautiful day, but luckily our table was all by itself, although it was still a tight squeeze. We were given room temperature water, with no ice, and then some menus. We had a game plan and knew we wanted to try a bunch of things, so we both ordered what we wanted and then split everything. We tried:  Peach and Pineapple mimosas $6 each- I had the peach and thought it was tasty and reasonably priced. I wish they had a bottomless option though, because who doesn't love bottomless mimosas during brunch?   Croque Madame $11- This was very good. This sandwich was made with challah bread, thick ham, gruyere cheese and a sunny side up egg, then the whole thing was covered in bechamel sauce. It was savory, salty and cheesy. It came with a side salad of arugula and tomatoes with a vinaigrette dressing which was good  Pb&J pancakes $13- Probably my favorite thing I tried. The pancakes were really sweet although there was minimal pb&j. I added some of their housemade vanilla syrup and yeah I'd like to purchase a bottle of that stuff asap.  Social Pecan Roll $3- We originally wanted the monkey bread but they were out, so we got this instead. It came out warm and had a nice flavor.  Jalapeno Bacon $4- It's bacon and it's jalapeno flavored. What's not to love?  Biscuits $3- The biscuits came out hot and were served with house made jam. These are the poster child of how biscuits should be-flaky, buttery and delicious.  Tostada $8- There are actually 2 tostadas to an order, which was perfect since we were sharing. The tostada had pork, black beans, slaw and a quail egg. There was also some sauce drizzled over the top of the tostada.   Breakfast Taquitos $9- The taquitos also had a slaw on top of them, this one was a lil spicy and had jalapenos but was quite good. I found myself eating the slaw by itself after the taquitos were long gone. The taquito itself was not memorable though.  Rachel also got coffee and a fruit cup for her son, which by the way took forever to arrive. I don't know if they don't have highchairs but we weren't offered one, so maybe think twice about bringing young kiddos. Our total for both meals was $75. Now I am by no means cheap, but this is ridonkulous for brunch. Looking back, I can't believe we spent that much money especially since we only ordered 2 main plates. We did get a military discount and that did knocked the price down $14, but nothing was so amazing that I have to come back and spend that much money again. All in all I think this was my first and last time here. The service was intermittent. Our food took about an hour to come out of the kitchen. They were out of 2 of the items (monkey bread and empanadas) we originally ordered so we had to settle for other things. And it was really warm in the dining room and made our dining experience a bit unpleasant.",neutral

"So, this restaurant maybe an old classic but it is new to me.   The menu is traditional breakfast fare. Omelettes, eggs, and of course, pancakes.   I must say the most recent evidence of God on earth is the potato pancake. OMG! they are awesome! with a little sour cream and salt & pepper. Worth waiting in the Saturday morning line.  Customer service is a bit lacking. I went to breakfast alone, as I have no friends...or at least none who will get up in the morning for breakfast. I was banished to the single's booth it was a half booth with a bench a half table and a half wall to face while eating.   It was a bit like a when you skip class and have to go to the testing center to make it up.   Bad, and demeaning. If it were not for the potato pancakes I would have made more of a fuss",neutral

"Dined here with my partner the other evening. Our experience was not the greatest. The hostess was professional and we were seated in a timley manner. Our waiter soon arrived with water and we placed our order. I ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake SautΓ©ed Maryland Style with Spicy Chive Remoulade  as my appitizer and the Georges Bank Scallops SautΓ©ed with Citrus Fruit, Roasted Almonds and Brown Butter for my main course. My appetizer was first to arrive. The crab cake did not have a balanced temperature, the outside was hot, and the inside was cold, it also had parts of the shell in it. I didnt even finish the Crab Cake because in almost every bite there was a piece of shell. My Main course arrived and i was happy to see that the waiter made sure not to have almonds in it. The Scallops were delicious the fresh citrius fruit went perfect with it. The Scallops was the best part of my entire experience. My partner on the other hand had a dry chewy meal and was disappointed with the amount a vegetable put on the dish. If you state that there are greens beans in the dish we should be able to see the green beans and not have to pick thru the vegetables trying to figure out what is what.  When observing the floor we noticed that the waiters were not attentive to thier tables, I guess a football game is more important than thier guests.   The restraunt is very upscale the waiters are wearing formal clothing I thought that we would have been treated better.  I would go back for the scallops but not the service.",neutral

"My sister, mom and I came here for facials.  We each had a groupon for a 1 hour custom facial.  Both my mom and sister had a great experience with Phoenix and Terry.  I, however, had a lackluster experience with a woman named Oksana.  This was our first visit, and my first facial EVER.  Oksana never introduced herself to me (I got her name from her business card she left me at the end) nor did she ask me any questions at all about my skin.  She simply left me to change into the robe and once she came back she went straight to work.  Fine.  I'm not much for conversation anyway.  I thought it was strange that she never told me what she was doing as she was doing it (like I said, I've never had a facial so I had no idea what was going on) and never asked me about any concerns I had with my skin, problem areas, products I used, etc.  The only time she even spoke to me was to ask me how often I had facials done, and when I told her that I never do, she scoffed and told me I needed one once a month because my acne is so bad.  I'll admit that I have had issues with acne since my early 20's but it comes and goes and is only really bad during those extra hormonal times.  Then she told me she couldn't do any massage (which was included in the package) because my acne was so bad and would be exacerbated by the massage.  She rubbed a gritty mask on my face and left me in the room alone for about 10 minutes, telling me not to get up and just relax.  Ha.  She came back and finished up and then without saying a word lowered the bed and told me to make an appt. for three weeks out and when I came back she could make some product suggestions. HA HA.  Please.  As if I would come back to see her again.  I also ended up having to wipe all the gritty crap off my face in the restroom before leaving because my skin felt disgusting.  The only reason I gave this place 3 stars is because my mom and sister had a wonderful experience.",neutral

The service is consistently good, and although this place is always busy, I've never had to wait for a seat and I've never felt like that place was too crowded. It can get a little noisy though, making it difficult to talk without feeling like you're shouting.  I typically get scrambled eggs with bacon, home fries, and rye toast with coffee. It's just okay. My biggest issue is with the home fries. Hands down, these are the worst home fries I've ever had. They are always cold and hard; they definitely have not been cooked enough, I may as well have eaten a raw potato. On my first visit I thought maybe this was a fluke and gave them another chance, but it's happened every single time I've eaten there. Hugely disappointing, as the home fries are always my favourite part of going out for breakfast. The eggs, bacon, and toast are fine, but nothing is good enough to make up for those home fries. There are much better places to go for a hot breakfast.",neutral

"K & K Specialty Tropical Fruit is a small fruit stand with fresh flavors not typically found outside of Asia, including one that ranks at the top of Andrew Zimmern's least favorite foods -- durian, a pulpy fruit that smells so bad that the store offers gloves to handle it. Unlike Andrew, my boyfriend and I ventured here only to find that the customer service was relly lacking. It was hard finding someone who spoke English, egich was fine but when we did they were not able to assist. We tried the pre cut durian which had no smell (not sure how fresh it was since it had been cut already). We really were hoping to try some exotic fruits but we did not. Overall, they have lots of exotic fruits and items to choose from. I think they would do a lot more business if they treated all customers like Andrew (lol), approach them and offer them some assistance.

We ordered an appetizer, the Sicilian Garlic Cheese Bread (absolutely amazing!) and we each got a different entrΓ©e. My dad loves spicy food, so he ordered the Spaghetti Vesuvius, which ended up not being spicy at all. My mom got the spaghetti with marinara sauce, which had absolutely no flavor. I got the spaghetti with the rich meat sauce which was tasty, but it could have had more flavor to it as well. Of course the spumoni ice cream for dessert was delicious. But we were not that impressed by the flavors of the food. I think I remembered that I loved the food so much because I was little and I didn't like spice. I think that the food items here are much better for children. On another occasion, we ordered OSF food for takeout while we were working. We got macaroni and cheese, spaghetti with marinara sauce, and the garlic cheese bread.. it was unanimous that the best thing out of all of those was the garlic cheese bread... needless to say we aren't going to be doing trade-outs with them anymore at work.",neutral

"A perfectly nice dining experience.  Service is good and the decor of the restaurant is chic and warm at the same time.  But the quality of the food (even though decent) just doesn't match the prices.  It's the kind of place to go if you want to impress your date with ambiance, rather than dive into authentic Indian cuisine.  We had the Winterlicious menu and it was quite tasty.  No complaints, just nothing really stood out as terrific.  My husband had the pakoras and I had the butternut squash soup.  His app was quite small (two pakoras sitting on top of some slaw) and mediocre.  Nothing like the crispy, oniony, fragrant morsels I've had at other places (ahem...Banjara).  My soup was quite good, though.  It had a great spicy kick to it and was rich with flavour.  Decent portion, too.    Our mains were also good, but oddly portioned.  I ordered the butter chicken.  If I wasn't pregnant and craving sugar right now, I'd probably complain that it was too sweet, but frankly I lapped it up.  My husbands vegetarian Buddha meal was three times the size of my butter chicken for the same price.  Chana Masala, Dahl Mahkenhi and Saag Paneer all in individual serving dishes.  Each dish was good - although VERY heavy on the cream - but we thought it was odd that the portion sizes were so different.  Dessert was a total disappointment.  My rice pudding was like rice-based oatmeal.  Goopy and unappealing.  And it's garnish was a compote made with dried cranberries, which seemed like a decision to cut costs.  I ate two spoonfuls and left the rest.  My husband's dessert, a haagen-dazs bar was...well...a little haagen-dazs bar on a plate.  Cute.  But can't give the restaurant much credit for that one.  There are so many great Indian places in this city.  Keep exploring, I say.    Vegetarian score: 7/10 - fewer choices than at most Indian restaurants because the menu is smaller than most (because it's ""fusion""?)  But you'll have no difficulty getting a satisfying meal and some choice.",neutral

"My husband and I come to Vegas about once a year and usually stay at his parents' timeshare at Planet Hollywood. However, we stayed here this time because the Trop is a Hilton property and he's a Hilton Honors member, so he gets points for the stay. Plus we had a Hilton gift card we had received as a wedding gift that we wanted to use.   Although the casino has recently been redone, it's not nearly as nice as other places we've stayed in Vegas. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful, but the decor is really tacky (even for Vegas standards), with lots of neon orange and loud floral prints. We stayed in a ""bungalow"" style room with a ""garden view."" The room itself was clean and pretty basic. I know the style is supposed to be 1950s beach bungalow chic - lots of teak and wicker - but it just makes the rooms look old and dated. Bed is super comfy, though.  Room service is available 24 hours, comes quickly and was pretty tasty. There isn't much shopping in the casino, however. We aren't big gamblers, so I don't have much input on that aspect of things, but there seemed to be plenty of slot machines and game tables.",neutral

I will land in the middle of Andrea K and Gabi K.  The hotel was gorgeous and great for people watching for sure!  At the ground floor was a lounge area called 'The Living Room' we had a very pricey drink although mine was good others had to send theirs back.  We were lucky that we were on the lists or I would have been feeling like Andrea mentioned in her review.  This is not Hollywood or New York this is Scottsdale people... get a grip on yourself and where you are.  There is no need to make people feel like they are not welcome... for that reason alone I was not that impressed with this place.  Once upstairs we walked around and checked the scene out.  They have a great pool area with very comfy looking lounge chairs... a small bar by the pool and another large one right when you first get upstairs.  I went to the smaller one to 'try' and get a drink... I think I was ignored for about 10 minutes or so till I finally said something and got a mediocre mixed drink that was not cheap either.  I cannot say that I wont be back for a drink again... maybe when the hype dies down.,neutral

"I used to be in the restaurant/bar business, and in many different capacities; from bartender to bouncer, from waiter to cook.  Because of these experiences I tend to be more patient with restaurant workers than most people, but the service I endured at Sweet Mellisa the other morning really pissed me off.  For starters my wife and I joined a group of five for brunch, and it took about ten minutes before the waitress came over to take our drink order, and then another 5 minutes for her to get it to us.  Now the dining room was busy, but I have always lived by the rule of getting the guest their drinks before anything else, it puts them at ease; and they had four or five people waiting tables, so the amount of customers to wait staff ratio wasn't awful.  At one point during the meal someone knocked over some coffee creamer right in front of the waitress, she completely ignored it, no biggie, I'm an adult I can clean it up, but... Then a little later I knocked over a cup of coffee (this really speaks to how cluttered the tables are) and a busboy and waitress were standing there and just staired, I got up and grabbed my own napkins from the bar.  Once again, I can clean it up, but a well trained wait staff grabs napkins and attempts to clean it up.  It was odd because it wasn't like our waitress really appeared to be busy, when she would go missing for 8-10 minutes it wasn't like we saw her running around the floor helping customers, she was no where to be found!  I had two eggs, potato's and bacon.  Lots of bacon, two eggs, and two little potato's?  Really, two potatoes?    Now you may be wondering why I gave three start if my experience was awful, well the food tasted great!  It wasn't real hot, because I assume that the kitchen staff isn't real proficient (only assuming based on how poor the wait staff was trained),  but tasted good none the less.  I was shocked that it tasted as good as it did, granted I had the most basic breakfast of all.  I tried someones french toast and it was to die for, I wish I would have ordered it!  Good food, terrible service, and a lot over priced based on portions.  For a place owned by a former waitress of Max's I can't believe how bad the wait staff was.   Will I go back?  I'm sure I will be in Ohio again and will want to give it another shot.  I assume the rest of their menu tastes just as good.  Sorry for beating the wait staff dead horse.",neutral

"Hey Las Vegas Yelpers!  So... I've been living in Vegas for 2 months now. Been here twice on a Monday, both visits were decent. First visit I rolled in with my friends who are promoters (for another venue), they had a table by the main stage and my second visit was this past Monday for yelp night and we had 2 tables in the back room. Both times I didn't have to wait in a line or pay to get in (and if I did, then I wouldn't waste my time trying to get into Jet or any other venue).  Decent size nightclub. Nothing is really wrong with this venue... but compared to other glamorous nightclubs on the strip... Jet is just ""another nightclub"". When I visited Vegas over the past years... I never came to Jet. But now as a local and people I know come here... I don't mind coming to Jet....    Would I recommend anyone coming to Jet? Only if you're staying at the Mirage and don't want to travel, sure. Otherwise... I rather dance the night away somewhere else (don't want to drop other venue names in this review).  Jet in my books is just A-Ok. Jet doesn't make my hit list of must go toos. But if you're just looking for a nightclub to party at and not picky about the ambiance or DJ... hit up JET :)) you can't go wrong.  Self parking is never a problem!  Enjoy!",neutral

REALLY good pizza.    Service was lacking ... it was a good 15 minutes before we were served our salad and ""chili"" and the pizza quickly followed about 5 minutes later.  We weren't provided with cheese or peppers (even though we asked) until we were halfway finished with the pizza.

So here is my review.. I order food online from the yelp app at 7:15 and got my food at 8:37.. Extant ion was 45 to an hour..special instructions weren't so specially to say lots of soy sauce on the side.. I was ol u provided with 2 little 2 go cups barely filled with soy sauce.. They had the cheap soy sauce at that (lay choy) instead of kikoman.. There are certain things u can't skimp on.. My egg rolls were a little greasy but still crispy after all of the wait.. I also got pork fried rice which was hot upon arrival but the pork was bland.. Hence the need for soy.. I doin dnt have a car today and had to order delivery.. Not too many options in my area.. I want to hold help accountable as well.. If a place does not deliver timely or anywhere near it they should remove that option from the app.. With that being said the driver was extremely nice.. I would order again if I had no vehicle once again,neutral

"I came here a few weeks ago for an office outing. We all try the wings and absolutely love them. I came back today to try them for a second time and I went with some untraditional flavors. I got the electric strawberry, enchilada, and the Beijing.   With the enchilada I was not impressed at all. I thought it was really really lacking flavor. The wing itself though was big and meaty. The electric strawberry reminded me of the strawberry jelly that you put on top of your ice cream but with a spicy kick. This flavor really wasn't for me but it wasn't bad. Out of the three  that I tried I would have to say the Beijing was probably my favorite. It had really nice big chunks of garlic witch I liked.    To be honestly I probably wouldn't order any of these three flavors again. But i really want to try every flavor you guys have. My server was super nice, friendly and attentive. I really  like the laid-back atmosphere. I will definitely be back to try other flavors.",neutral

"Vanity was suggested to me from a friend, she had picked up a great lotion here.  I was browsing the little boutique for a bit before a woman came out to the front and greeted me.  She asked if I had an appointment, I said no, I was just looking at their skin products.  She didn't offer any further help.  I was after their hemp lotion, but a small container of body butter was $22.  The other Suki lavender and lemongrass lotions they had were too strongly scented for me.  They had a gardeners soak that looked really appealing, but I don't ""soak"" often.  There were these really cute retro ice bags for $20, I had to have one!  There was a few more professional products as well.  They have a selection of make up, which was quite pricey.  I asked about getting the simple vanities package on the up coming weekend, but the lady said they were full.  Their packages go for $180 to $300.  Don't plan to just walk in here for services, the place isn't very big and it seems its best to book ahead.

"I was never a fan of AYCE sushi. Even after reading the good reviews about this place, I still wasn't interested in coming here since I already had a favorite sushi spot! However, we had family in town a few weeks ago who asked us to bring them here, so I finally got to see what it was all about. So many reviews here already, so I'll try to keep mine short and sweet.   A few things I would like to point out..... First, we got lucky with the wait time. They told us we would be waiting about 40 minutes. But because a big party left, it opened up like 3 tables and we only waited about 20 minutes. I thought it was kind of cool that they text you a link that shows your place in line and how long you have waited so far to keep track of your time.  Second, we unfortunately got a table that was close to the entrance door. It was so crowded and people were waiting inside the narrow entrance way (as if this place isn't tiny enough). I got annoyed because it felt like the whole time, strangers were watching me eat. Sorry, but it sucks when you cant enjoy your meal because people keep looking over your shoulder!  Lastly, I'm sorry, but the sushi just wasn't that great. I ordered a few rolls, but nothing stood out or gave me a reason to come back again. They may have sounded fancy on the menu, but the taste was disappointing. However, I will say this. Their rice to meat/fish/veggies/what have you is great. They don't pack on the rice or are not stingy with the other ingredients, which some sushi places definitely do.   Anyway, glad I finally tried it, but no thank you. I don't mind paying more for sushi that I can definitely enjoy elsewhere!",neutral

"Interesting experience tonight. Been to many Landry's spots, and have always had a reasonably good time. With the exception of the uncomfortable bar stools, tonight was no exception... until I went to close out...   The nice bartender went to run both my credit and ""Select Club"" card, but their system was not working. After waiting a while, the bartender apologized and called over the manager. After waiting some more, the bartender asked the manager if he could buy me a drink to apologize for the long wait (keep in mind I had already bought two drinks one for $11 and one for $15) - not only did the manager refuse and look at the bartender like he was nuts right in front of me, but he never even acknowledged that I had been waiting at all. A few minutes later the manager gave up, and had the bartender close me out by hand (think carbon paper receipt where they write down all of your private credit card info and have you sign). Not once did the manager apologize for the wait, or even acknowledge the fact that I had been waiting at all; despite the fact that this whole attempt to ""fix the system"" occurred right in front of me on the other side of the bar. I have no problem with the fact their system was down, but disappointed this is the way the manager elected to handle the situation. I applaud the bartender for his efforts to correct the issue - his instincts were correct. The manager's service etiquette is another story... this is not what I would expect at Chili's, let alone McCormick and Schmick's... What started as a great meal, ended with a bad taste in my mouth.",neutral

The other tacos come on wheat tortillas and are grilled like quesadillas. It's kind of weird to have grill marks on tacos. They were tasty, but nothing amazing. Pork and chicken tacos are served with refried beans and rice. Again, good, but nothing amazing. I think possibly the fish taco platter is the way to go, since it uses corn tortillas and served with lime, along with salad and rice.",neutral

"We were excited to take out-of-town friends with us to try House of Tricks for the first time. Our table was ready on time and the check-in was pleasant. Unfortunately, it went downhill from there. The patio is beautiful so we opted to sit outside. The table, glasses, silverware and napkins were covered with little leaves and detritus from the trees. We ended up having to clean it off ourselves when the hostess dropped the menus and scurried away. The food was reasonable, not bad but certainly not with the premium prices; and our waiter, though mostly competent, appeared to be quite stoned. None of the food was even interesting enough to report here. We had a nice evening with our friends, but wish we would have taken them to any of the myriad other excellent restaurants in the valley.",neutral
"I'm on the hunt for a work related vehicle and I have a big range from potentially something as large as a Mercedes Sprinter, down to a minivan. I'm not a soccer mom, so I'd rather stay away from a minivan.  I came in here one evening to check out a Scion xB to see if it would suit my needs. I was immediately greeted my a sales person who did his little bit to determine what I was looking for. As I was looking for cargo space he made a few suggestions. This turned into the story of Goldilocks and the three bears.  The xB was too small. The Highlander was too big. But the Venza was just right!  Oh yeah, for comparisons sake there was the Sienna too but as I said before: NO MINIVANS!  I was surprised how long it was without being an SUV. It looked nice and the specs seemed to be in line so how does it feel. Time for a test drive.  Right at that moment the salesperson's evening appointment walked in so I was passed on to someone else. He grabbed my license info and said he would meet me around front. After about 20 minutes he finally showed up. Apparently they couldn't find the keys at first and then they couldn't find the car. Painful.  The test drive was good though. I was surprised how the car still felt like a car and not a bulky SUV for its size. Overall I was impressed.  We went back to the office to talk numbers.  At the end of my visit it was good to narrow down what could work out for me on the small end of my potential vehicle range. Now off to find something on the larger end.",neutral

I did order a regular size with boba but ended up adding some honey to my drink once I got home. I'm not sure if they have sweetener in their cream but next one I'll stick to a regular house green milk tea.  I also ordered a regular Hokkaido milk tea and wanted to add less milk but was told that they can't adjust it because it's a powder and premade. Brew tea allows for adjustments on their Hokkaido milk tea. The Hokkaido milk tea is ok, not overly sweet but definitely not one of my favorites.   Some people compared tea space so half & half. I'm from SoCal and LOVE half and half so I'll be back to try their iced milk drinks.",neutral

Here is a place close to the house that we frequent more when the weather is warmer. They have a nice area outside to sit and relax. The food is decent enough but not all that special. There isn't a large menu but there is a bit of seafood or steak if that is your desire. The burgers are big and you can replace your fries with a nice chopped salad. The drinks are priced well below places like Applebee's or Chili's so enjoy one with your meal. Would I rave about this place?

Great waitress and service and the pork chili was amazing!!!  BUT the last time that we came in with a couple of friends last Saturday just to have a drink at the bar wasn't so great! We didn't order any food just drinks. We sat down and didn't even get a hello,from the bartender.  A guy ( that looked like maybe a manager) took our drink order so when our drinks came, all we got was ""are you ordering any food"" from our not so friendly girl bartender. My Bloody Mary was super salty and I put it a side as I was not going to drink it. We sat there about 45 minutes so my friends could finish their drinks, still not one word from the bartender. No "" how you doing"" or "" I see your not drinking your drink, everything ok?"" Nothing!! Very unfriendly, grouchy like she didn't want to be there or be bothered by anyone. Very disappointing!!! She really needs an attitude adjustment. I get that people have bad days but really? Not one word to us on how we are doing or a thank you?!

"After all the rave reviews of this restaurant we were very disappointed last night. First of all the restaurant is beautiful inside but small and therefore extremely noisy especially if there is a larger group inside. Last night there was a large group and a group of four drunk  people all of which were Extremely Loud. This is not the fault of the restaurant the loud patrons I mean , however the Acoustics are terrible. We chose to eat outdoors and I have to say I am comparing this to Monarch CafΓ© and there's no comparison. Where as Monarch has a magnificent beautifully lit Courtyard this place has plastic chairs sitting adjacent to Main Street. They have done absolutely nothing to decorate.   You are having a very expensive meal and the outdoor Ambiance is something like a fast food place.  The meal was not spectacular, again I am comparing it to Cafe Monarch. Because they are the same type of restaurant with a limited menu and in fact the chef used to cook at Monarch. The food was nowhere near as interesting. The service was good but nowhere near as excellent as monarch. And it took forever to dine there almost 3 hours. The time between courses was OK until the end and then we must have waited 45 minutes for our main course. The waiter offered to buy us a glass of wine that was nice of him however if I drink too much before I eat I don't care if I eat any more and that pretty much was the case last night.  Now this is another Personal Taste here and I didn't hold it against the restaurant but I didn't care for the location. Watching drunken people especially drunken women in Sky High shoes staggering about  unable to walk in their shoes even sober let alone inebriated  coming up and down Main Street was not particularly my idea of great Entertainment.",neutral

"I can report several comical and odd things here.  1- It is both a take-out and a dine-in restaurant, but everyone has to order at the cashier. I was taking out. 2- They only had one lone employee in the open kitchen area and he was also making kabobs for the staff. Guess where this story will go from here. 3- As mentioned, half their business is for take-out, but they have not bothered to put a sign or overhead menu at the cash. On your way to the cashier there is a poster for ""pizza."" Who in their right mind orders pizza... at a Lebanese restaurant? Well, maybe some people will .... 4- .... the kitchen had two baskets of French fries on the go! Who in their right mind goes to an Arabic restaurant and orders French fries?? Reminds me of the time I was dining with friends at Bombay Bhel and the food's options were a- with rice or b- with naan or c- with fries!! After laughing at the possibility of someone eating fries at an Indian restaurant the waiter served the table next to us... French fries... true story! Yuck! 5- Back to Paramount. It is a good chain and both the beef and chicken were pretty good for a chain. The prices were average as well. They have a whole section dedicated to sweets and cookies, which we always pass on. Regardless, it is there. I do have to say that the lady who wrapped and packaged the food was quite polite, smiling and deliberately made sure she asks my name and used it with a wide grin. So five stars for politeness and trying! Ample parking available in this plaza as well.",neutral

Rumored to be popular during the weekend, a reservation thus made for 11:30am, it was precisely on time that I entered the front doors reading ""Welcome to my heart,"" a man named Michael greeting me with ""just a minute"" before wandering away for more than seven, much of it spent kibitzing with regulars as patrons both entering and exiting were forced to squeeze past me in the chilly, tight foyer.

Finding the kitchen far more efficient than front of house staff, the sleek and narrow space run by just two, it was only perhaps fifteen minutes after an order was placed that two plates were presented, the cast-iron skillet containing nine Meatballs still bubbling hot beneath melted Cheese and golden Eggs while the mixture of Sweet Potato and more traditional white dumplings were each pillow-soft amidst nuggets of Wild Boar Bacon, whole Walnuts and Maple-infused Butter plus Balsamic.  Eventually allowing the ping-pong ball-sized Meatballs enough time to cool, the majority smooth and rich though residual heat from the skillet had unfortunately rendered some a bit rubbery,  an accompanying laminated pastry was fairly well constructed and nicely paired to zesty Yuzu Marmalade with flavors a pleasant prelude to Tiramisu served in a flower pot with well-separated layers of creamy Mascarpone and sopping-wet Ladyfingers beneath crunchy Chocolate 'soil.'",neutral

Maybe a few beers at Dakota would change my mind. Perhaps a tequila flight or two from Reposado would make me more star generous... But even drunk and starving, I don't think I would change my mind. It's a perfectly average bowl of pho.  We wandered in here on a rainy day for a steamy hot bowl of broth. The place was busy for a mid-week gloomy evening.  Pho places on the Ossington strip look a lot like grimy run-down pho places in Chinatown. The floor was seriously filthy, they had the standard plastic utensils, and decor was basic and lacked any kind of effort.    Looked promising.  We started with the spring rolls. Super small. Not much to them, really.   Tasty... now bring me 3 more of them.  The pho wasn't bad at all, don't get me wrong.

First time trying  the restaurant.  Place looked clean and friendly.  They told us it was a 20 to 25 minute wait but they were not overly  busy . We got seated  in 15 minutes.  Waiter  was very attentive.  We needed more time once we placed the order it took about 40 minutes  to get our food . Worse they brought the last order 10 minutes  later with no apologies.  . I had their three pieces  of chicken  with two sides.  Red beans with rice and fried  okra. .there was not much h beans.  Mostly rice . The okra was swimming in oil. I did like the corn bread.  Chicken was crunchy.  But overcooked and no seasoning. Sorry but Popeye is a better. Choice.  The waitress  disappeared  on us for 15 minutes.  . Food looked fresh but it was marginal,neutral

"Got the higher priced ticket and sat in the front row at the very end.  This revue features a band that consists of a drummer and a keyboard/sax player.  That's it.  They did a great job considering there was only two of them.  The band has two backup singers, and the woman singer occasionally sits in on piano.  The highlight of the show were the male singers, especially when they sang together as the Four Tops.   I thought the real star of the show was the guy singing the Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson songs.  He seems very charismatic with a great smile.  Frankly, I was puzzled by the line up of talent.  The songs didn't really come close to comprehensively covering the genre of soul music.  The songs seemed to match the singers' strength instead.  For example, there was a middle aged woman who looked a bit like Dionne Warwick and sang only Dionne Warwick songs and nothing else.    Finally, the show featured four female dancers and two of them handled backing vocals too.  I guess they add to the act if you like Vegas dance routines.    The room is pretty small but wide, so getting a higher priced ticket like we did wasn't that necessary.  A few rows back would have been just fine.    Bottom line:  This show isn't nearly as good as Hitzville at the V Theater outside of Planet Hollywood.  But still fun.",neutral

"Red Robin is and always will be a mediocre hamburger restaurant with a variety of appetizers. The entire menu is burgers, that's their thing. I guess you also have to mention they have the speckled lemonades and decent iced tea as well.   My last venture to Red Robin was because I was out with a friend in Henderson and we needed a place to grab lunch. Well, I hadn't been to Red Robin in awhile so we figured hey why not.  We arrived a bit after lunchtime so the place was pretty dead. We were seated fairly promptly and the service was good. Our waiter didn't mess up our order, he checked up on us, etc.   I ordered a chicken sandwich. Honestly I can't even remember the name, but it was of the grilled variety. The only thing I can really say about it is I did not enjoy the super white breaded bun it came on. I just think I've become used to better slices of bread. I've become spoiled by other places I suppose. My friend ordered a chicken sandwich as well and I believe hers had some pineapples on it.   Their large steak fries were tasty and add a bit of variety to the meal. The waiter also asked us if we would like certain types of sauces to dip the fries in, which was nice of him.  Overall the food was okay, the service was very nice and competent, the restaurant was clean, and so was the bathroom. They do have a bar at the back of this location. I didn't realize that came standard with Red Robin, but hey, it does.  Would I be back? Hmmm. Possibly. But there are a lot of better places to get a burger in Vegas.",neutral

There's no denying that deep fried, crunchy calamari is tasty, but there wasn't enough. Thrown into the mix were deep fried slices of cherry peppers and lemon slices -- mm, nope. More calamari and less filler, please.   As we waited for our pizza, our server came by and told us that it wasn't placed in the oven. We were offered complimentary garlic knots as we waited.

"One of the better food choices if you want to stay away from the high concentration of pubs or bars in the area. Attached to the Delta Hotel, the service is attentive and there is plenty of seats in a slightly fancier environment to enjoy a drink or watch a game.   I walked in fully intending to order a salad, but got waylayed by the 5 cheese mac and cheese on the menu. It was creamy, heavy. and comforting. I was only able to finish half of it, so maybe the better plan is to split it with someone and order something healthy to counter balance all the carbs and cheese.",neutral

"I want to really love Gold's because of its accessibility, its affordability, and all around amenities offered. I can practically take any type of class I want--yoga, weight-lifting, cycling, etc--all throughout the day, 7 days a week. There are plenty of machines, even during peak hours, and I guess I get 2 free personal training classes just for enrolling.  Despite this, it is hard to look beyond the lack of attention to functionality of the gym and the demand for the pool. The area to the right of the machines on the main floor has ample space for stretching, core work, and a TRX station...Why are there no mirrors here? Form is a wonderful thing to assess when doing planks. Instead, there are several large windows that serve really only the purpose of letting in the occasional bright light of cars...and the occasional car to check out my rear. Lady Gold's.....why? The room is so small it's uncomfortable with only a few people in it. Its small areas with mirrors and mats can barely serve the needs of two people. The ""main"" weight area is accompanied by so many power lifters and machines that even I, as a former D1 female athlete, find it extremely uncomfortable and intimidating. Make lady gold's and the main weight area one; tackle the stigma head on that women should feel inferior if they can't use these big bulky weights and machines with Hulk Hogan at my side. Don't make us feel more ""comfortable"" in a claustrophobic room.  And finally, the pool...yes the area that triggered this snap. Why do you not have a separate pool for the ""demand"" of aqua class? A previous reviewer also brought this up and it was dismissed and noted that there are plenty of times that the pool is in fact ""open."" Frankly, I I initially thought the guy reviewing could have easily adjusted his schedule to accommodate an hour long class...Well, now that I'm here enrolled and swimming:  you have to consider getting to the gym at 4 am to get your swim in because master's swim is at 545 am to 7 am Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Then it's also offered 1130 am Tuesdays and Thursdays so don't think about always going during lunch. Aqua class is also at 945 on Monday, 430 pm on Tuesday, 9 am on Wednesday,  515 pm on Wednesday, 430 pm Thursday, 9 am Friday, and 8 am Saturday. Now, factor in that everyone takes these classes into account, tries to swim right before or right after. You are almost never guaranteed your own lane. You should consider yourself lucky if you have your own lane or don't have to wait to share a lane. So...why is there no searatw aqua class pool like at Pinnacle if there is so much demand for it? The gym should know plenty of their members enroll to swim the pool. I cant even count the number of times I've swam next to former collegiate swimmers, elite triathletes, and every day people looking to take stress off their joints but remain active. Right now, I'm not really convinced it was a smart move to pick Gold's for the pool over Pinnacle. I'd rather have a higher membership fee than dealing with the stress of trying to get 3 swims in during the week alongside an array of classes for a small group of about 15 people. Overall, I'm looking forward to leaving once the weather is nice enough for an outdoor pool that doesn't disregard swimmers despite its presence of a lap lane pool.",neutral

My backyard burger windsor style was hot and cooked properly. What was missing was savory flavor. Everything was sweet with no balance. The burger itself did not taste to be seasoned and all the accoutrements were sweet including the bun. My wife got the crab cake BLT and it was assembled and cooked fine, but it is just a bad design. It comes on a huge chewy hoagie roll that drowns out any crab or bacon flavor and is virtually impossible for humans to put in their mouths. The chopped kale salad was way too tough to eat. A quick blanche of the kale followed by an ice bath would improve this a great deal. The bartender was knowledgeable and fun. The food was awkward. Really should be 2.5 stars instead of three.",neutral

"This experience was deficient in many ways, but was salvaged by some outstanding employees, including a server whose intentions were good.  Welcome to wonderful Eddie Merlot's.  I wish you much success and fulfillment as you undertake the challenges of managing this fine restaurant.  Our reservation was for 6:00.  We arrived early and were seated at 5:40.  Weston, with whom I have conversed on prior occasions, is the consummate host.  He greeted us warmly, congratulated us on our anniversary, mentioned and honored my OpenTable preference for a booth in the most quiet area of the restaurant.  We were not disappointed with our seating.  The young lady who seated us was pleasant and gracious as well.  A young lady whom we thought might be our server promptly came to determine what type of water we would like and it was delivered. We were then ""dropped"" for more than fifteen minutes as we sat there, waiting for someone to take at least our cocktail orders.  Eventually, our server recognized our status and asked if someone had taken our order.  He stepped in to do so.  Cindy, whose charm and people skills are superior, had become aware of what happened and came over to apologize for our lengthy wait for service.  At this point we were more than ready to order. I believe that instead of assuming that every guest, including returning guests, want a lengthy presentation about the restaurant, that the server should ask whether we have dined there before and then see whether it is necessary to repeat what has been stated during prior dining experiences.  We would have politely declined if asked.  My wife's berry white martini was beautiful and delicious.  My summer ruby spritz was served on the rocks, which I did not realize from the description and did not request.  It was small and mostly ice, but also delicious.  Ground pepper was not offered with our salads, but Cindy promptly responded to my request for it.  I asked our server for the salads to be brought before the filet mignon pot sticker appetizer.  The salads came first as I requested, but he then forgot the appetizer as our entrees were delivered next.  I asked about the appetizer and he said it would be brought right out.  It arrived about ten minutes later.  The appetizer was tiny for the price, but tasty.  I was surprised that we were charged for it, given that it arrived well after the entree.  My pork chops entree was dry and not seasoned; the sauce that accompanied it helped.  My wife's chicken florentine was outstanding: tender, deliciously seasoned meat.  The server brought us dessert menus and suggested that Lizzie would be in the best position to give us the details, which she did.  She was engaging and pleasant.   It took a long time to receive the dessert after ordering it and then to receive the check.  When the check arrived, I found that my $35 Chef's Faves pork chop dinner, which I clearly specified I was ordering, was not on the bill.  Instead, there were a la carte charges of $32.95 for the same pork chops as offered in the Faves dish and $7.95 for the salad.  I brought this to the server's attention and he changed it appropriately.  After we had paid the check and ordered and consumed chocolate cake, it was recognized by the restaurant that this we were marking our anniversary as I specified in my reservation.  At that point, complimentary champagne and creme brulee were graciously brought to the table.  We could not do justice to the creme brulee as we had just finished the large order of chocolate cake.  Our server is charming, gracious, engaging, and suave, which went a long way toward erasing the facets of the meal that were not what we should have received.  Every staff member we dealt with was superior.",neutral

"Not bad. Today was the second time I have had their food, but the first time I dined in.   We had burgers--double cheeseburger for me and bacon cheese burger for my stepson. They should be better. They are charcoal grilled from what I understand, but I can't taste it. The meat tastes pretty much like a standard fast-food burger. Not bad, mind you, but not great. That said, their fries and onion rings were good. Next time I want to try the tri-tip sandwich and others in my house want to try the albacore tuna. Others have raved about those.   Of course, this is a fast food place (but it is not fast, everything is made to order), so the decor reflects that. No points off for that since it is exactly what you would expect. Service was good.   In all, a decent place and a good addition to the neighborhood. Maybe I can bump it up a star after I try the tri-tip.",neutral

"Comparatively speaking to the bubble tea places located in that area (i.e. Ten Ren's, The Sugar, etc.).  I find that the Green Grotto Room is not bad for its price and its quality.   Firstly, the ambiance is not bad there.  Lots of magazines for the... Asian magazine reader (which, I am not).  However, there's free wi-fi located there, so I guess you can get a lot of work or... MSNing done there.  I had the baked mochi with ice cream and red bean.  Ordered a red bean hot milk tea along with it.   The red bean milk tea actually had red bean in it - which surprised me thoroughly!  Much better than the one that I ordered at The Sugar.  The baked mochi was questionable.. Didn't really taste much mochi - but it was cheaper than most desserts that I have encountered at other places.  A noted drink is the lime yogurt (calpis?) drink.  I was surprised about the tangy taste to it!  Nice place just to chill and have a night out with a few friends to chat.",neutral

"I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Brick House. It was decorated in a cute way and has very comfortable seating.  The menu looked really good, so I chose a grilled chicken sandwich.  The chicken was not a fresh grilled breast. It tasted like a frozen, ""pre-grilled"", rubbery chicken breast. I was quite surprised at this, but the whole sandwich was just chewy and spongey. My salad was a little boring.  The service was good and our waitress was pleasant.  I would probably go back and try something else, but for my first visit, the sandwich did not impress me.",neutral
"The service started out really nice. Our server took great care of us initially. She was prompt and polite. It was wonderful. Then I placed an order to go. Good grief. It took longer for the 1 to go order than it took for the 3 of us to eat initially.   The food was pretty good. The muffins, as everyone says, were delicious.  I had a bandito scramble. It had a lot of cheese and just didn't look like what I expected for the items that were supposed to be in it. It was delicious though. In addition, the potatoes that came with it were wonderful!  My daughter has the Mexican omelet. She was in seventh heaven....eyes rolling, lips smacking, spoon licking heaven. Who could blame her? The food was really good!  The wait for our take out, and the aggressiveness of the manager cost them a star. I thoroughly recommend coming here, just be prepared to wait a minute or two.",neutral

"My mom, cousin and I went to Oak Steakhouse on a Thursday evening for drinks and appetizers around 6:30 p.m. I did make a reservation and upon arrival we were seated quickly. I had been wanting to try this restaurant out for months because I saw posts about it on Charlotte Agenda's Instagram page and then started following Oak's Instagram page. Unfortunately it was not the dining experience I hoped for, but it also was not terrible. Like other reviews mentioned, the service was slow and the time it took for the food and drinks to come out was absolutely ridiculous! That is the one thing I actually hated about the restaurant. The decor is perfect and that is one of the main reasons I wanted to give the restaurant a try. It's a somewhat smaller restaurant but with an open and airy feel. I'm in love with the dark hardwood floors, dark tables and chairs (minus the cute red booth in the center of the restaurant) and high ceilings. The food was pretty good to me, everything seasoned perfectly. I had shrimp cocktail and scallops for my appetizer. Although both were VERY good, I hate lukewarm food and my scallops could have been a little hotter. For my meal I had the oak salad and added steak on top. I was in love! IF I ever decide to go back I would definitely get all the items I ordered again. The drinks were definitely yummy! I did not see a drink I wanted on the menu so I asked the server to ask the bartender to make something light and fruity and the bartender did their thing, taste wise. However I do feel they were a little stingy with the alcohol. I did not taste a whole lot of it in my drink. Disappointing. Last but not least, our server. So our server was not bad at all. He just didn't seem all that interested in his job and I didn't feel he was as attentive as he should have been. He did check on us, however there were times I had to flag him down for another drink or food order. He was young, and just overall had a weird disposition. One thing I did appreciate was the manager coming over and apologizing about how long our food took. I was actually a little surprised by how long we waited each time we ordered food. There could possibly be an issue with the amount of kitchen staff they currently have because one large party should not stop the flow of the restaurant. All in all I am unsure if I will be back. I feel the customer service can be improved and the length of time it takes for the food to come out can be improved. Stronger drinks would have been nice too. My bill was $96 and I left the server an additional $15. If I do decide to go again I'll probably just sit at the bar.",neutral

The only reason I give it 3 stars is that the menu is somewhat limited and though its supposed to be family friendly, it felt very weird to have a toddler there. But the staff was fairly friendly.",neutral

"God bless Taco Tuesdays and the genius who invented the concept. I went on a Tuesday night for that very reason because it's hard to pass up a $2.50 taco.   Their taco menu is quite extensive so whether you love carnitas or fish or veggies, you will likely find something to tempt you. I tried the nopalitos and huitlacoche y champinon, which had mushroom and other veggies. They were pretty small tacos and I've had better nopales elsewhere but for $5 total, it's hard to complain! I particularly enjoyed the veggie taco as the earthiness of mushrooms always plays well with the queso fresco. My friend and I ordered the table side guacamole, which had pomegranate seeds throughout. The chips were pretty good- homemade, crunchy, and fresh- and they were generous on the avocado. Even with a margarita, the total bill was about $15. Not bad for a dinner out! Being from the taco capital of the US, I suppose I may be snobbier about my tacos. But hey, Barrio is a great deal with a good atmosphere and totally worth it for Taco Tuesday!",neutral

Three of us came here recently after dinner plans at a nearby restaurant fell through.  We had the following:  Small plain hummus served with pita Small babaganoush with pita Side falafel Side gyro meat with pita bread Greek trio Γ  la carte Baklava Rice pudding  The hummus was good but was surpassed by the babaganoush.  I liked the thickness of the babaganoush.  I thought the pita was mediocre.  The side of gyro meat was my other favorite of the night--not counting dessert.  There was a $.50 charge for the pita that we ordered with the meat.  The  meat was tender and flavored nicely.  The Greek trio was good with the mousaka being the stand out.  Both desserts were very good.  I liked that the baklava was not drenched in honey and nuts as many places do and the rice pudding was quite good.  Prices were good for the meal.,neutral

"Food was ok, the service was good.  This place is cool and is famous for 'gourmet' grilled cheese.  I just call it overpriced grilled cheese. Positives are they have a kids menu with crayons and stuff and are kid friendly.  Pittsburgh Salad was good and had a fried egg on top.  The WacArnold was good (their play on a Big Mac- Patty melt style), but a tip would be to skip the lettuce on it. It's that mixed green lettuce and it comes to you all wilted and makes the sandwich taste like dirt.  They have vegetarian options also for the veg lovers.

"Our food was outstanding but everything else was just ""meh.""  We came here early around 5:30 (hiking all the way up to Tom's dang Thumb will make you ravenous for the rest of the day!) but were told all the empty tables were being held for reservations. We were offered spots at the bar or to take seats at their ""communal tables""...I'm usually fine with communal tables, since they're long and spaced out for parties. These were two separate 6 tops. We had another couple join the table in the middle of our meal and it was just...weird. At least join the two together to space people out? I noticed at least two other parties walk in, say they didn't have a reservation, but then get seated at a table. Huh.  Anyway, we wait way too long for our server to greet us. She apologized, but we were about to walk out. (See previous review re: Fox RC's being the only ones to do it right, which is so odd to me.) Luckily, the food was great. The hummus board is a work of art, and all the veggies were drizzled with pesto and local honey. It was such a great, beautiful version of a hummus appetizer. I opted for the half chicken, which was served with some more of the same roasted veggies and smashed, roasted fingerlings. It was all delicious, as was my husband's braised short rib over risotto. The wait between our appetizer and main course was, again, way too long.  We spent over $100 for dinner, and were just a little underwhelmed by everything but the food. Probably a pass in the future. But kudos to the kitchen.",neutral

"I went to Hillstone for the first time tonight.  The restaurant is quite striking and in many ways is a homage to Frank Lloyd Wright--very prairiesque in its design.  we sat at the bar--when I got there at 5:30  the wait was a half hour, by later in the evening it had grown to 1.5 hours so, at least now don't consider it if you want a quick bite.  Even at the bar--folks seem to have settled in for the evening --me included--as I was there for almost three hours.  I have to say the wine starts at $9 a glass so if you plan to spend the evening it is not going to be inexpensive--so no so much because of the food--except for the fact that there was one special that was steak and was $40--which I think is somewhat outrageous for this economy  anyway--to get back to the food--I had the club salad--and it was nice--nothing spectacular--i think why I will go back is more for the ambiance of the restaurant it self--service from the bar was okay--they are busy so don't expect a service level that blows your socks off, but I do think they were giving it their best shot.  in spite of it all --there was a nice vibe sitting at the bar that I liked.",neutral

Atmosphere is simple, low volume but man oh man, we thought we were being poached alive (and it's not hot outside).  Service was less than desirable. I think with training, they could rock it.

"Had two different experiences, went once for a facial w/ acne add on and loved it so much that I went back to try out their hair stylist.   Let's start off with the facial: It was fabulous. The room was all the way back away from the louder area of the salon/spa so it was really quiet. I was so happy about that because that is the worst thing-listening to other people in the hallway while you're trying to relax. The lady who performed the service was amazing and so skilled. I melted in her hands and it was the best facial i've ever had.  They had some offer as I was checking out that I would be entered into a raffle for prebooking appointments which I did- but left the ticket on the counter. Called back 10 minutes after I left and all I got was a sorry :/   For the haircut: This will break down into another two sections: the haircut and the style. For the cut itself I was not displeased, but I wasn't in love with the cut either. It doesn't seem like any weight was taken out of my hair and the layers weren't as distinct as I normally have them. If I had gone for a style alone I would have left one star. It was a blowdry that I would have expected from someone still in school. My hair was a big frizz ball and didn't look like I had just come from a salon and spent $55 for a level 4 stylist. (one of their mid-high stylist)  As I left I asked the front desk what they thought, they thought I looked great, very unenthusiastically ;) I took a picture and sent it to their manager--she offered a free style. Great, but I wasn't too excited to back anytime soon.   I'll be back for another facial--but still searching for a good stylist!",neutral

"3.5 STARS  If you are desperate need for a hat - run to this store!  They have all kinds for men and women, ranging in different sizes.  From casual to fancy to hey I'm going to the Kentucky Derby, you'll find it here.  Staff seem to really know their stuff and there is even a small area where they sell feathers so you can add them to your hat!  I did overhear one person who came in because the had re-done her hat (I guess it was stretched out or needed re-fitting so I assume if you bought your hat from here and it needs some care they can help you out!)  The only thing is, while I loved a lot of the hats, the prices were a bit too steep for me.  Especially if I needed one for just an occasion.  But if you wear hat on a regular basis then I would spend the money to get the quality that is here  The sign at the front says it has been in business since 1895 and the inside has that dark library in a mansion kinda room feel to it which I love.

"It's good to finally have a healthy fast food option at the Mills. Green Leaf's is like a mini salad bar, you pick your lettuce either spring mix or romaine, four sides and a dressing for between 7-8 dollars. You can choose additional sides for a dollar a piece. Sides include the usual, cucumber, shrooms, olives, cheese, my favorite jalapenos etc..however they have a slightly seasoned tasty chicken, and big chunks of Bacon not bits but big bites of Bacon! At a quick glance there is a good selection of dressings at least ten, with a chipotle something or other and  Mmm sriracha..of which I didn't notice until after I chose the usual ranch, epic fail! The labels are hard to read in small print wrapped around the top of the bottles, and I didn't see them listed anywhere. My suggestion is they list them on the case, reducing squinting, and people's faces & handprints on the glass. Your salad selections are tossed in a big bowl, mixed with your desired  amount of dressing and put in a not as deep as it looks to go container.

"I don't know what to say about reviewing a Gourmet Fine Foods place, because there's a lot you have to consider. First of all, my perspective is someone who usually shops at No Frills/Asian supermarkets etc. Now, let's begin.   Obviously, it's different. It's in a category of its' own a.k.a UPscale. For me, when I have previous knowledge of something, it alters my perspective. This is also known as  e x p e c t a t i o n s.  I mean, if you know this place is going to be gourmet, you're going to have a certain standards. Like so:   1. I expect a more sophisticated group of shoppers (the rich) 2. I expect a reguar bag of chips to be almost 2x more expensive. 3. I expect the quality produce to be fresh and not even have to THINK about considering if it's ripe or not. 4. I expect to find everything up-to-date and not have to worry about expired foods on the shelf. 5. I expect friendly, genuine, and knowledgeable staff at hand. 6. I expect the quality of the food to modernize their store.  Don't you?  So, these are MY expectations, but the big question is... did they meet them?   Not quite.   Here's why:  The atmosphere is certainly nice. I always like a change from the regular No Frills stop to a nice treat like, Pusateri. But, I'll be honest, their staff are pretty much the same you'd find at No Frills.  I ordered a Soy Chai Latte and a carrot cake. The barista forgot my order, so I had to wait a bit longer. He was apologetic about the delay, and I was too. In the time I waited, I should have cancelled my order as it was a cup of dissapointing, watered down, underspiced 'latte'. Even my sister, who has never tried a soy chai latte said 'it tastes like nothing.'  On the other hand, my carrot cake was not bad. The icing was average. As for the cake itself, quite moist, and for $2.50, I'd say the portion was pretty decent. I'm still on the hunt for the best carrot cake in Toronto (suggestions would be great)   I also tried a cheese cake and many other desserts from Pusateri's, but I can't judge those because Pusateri is only the womb which the baby is born in. If I were to actually criticize, I'd have to see the baby itself. So Rahier's Patisserie's, watch out. 'cause you'll be reviewed next seeing as though you provide Pusateri with your cakes!  *On a lighter note, their produce is certainly top-notch. I've never tried their hot foods, but it does look quite delicious. But like I said before, the experience itself shopping in such a place like this should be one left with full satisfation and I was not fully satisfied. (I guess this note didn't turn out so light...)",neutral

"I'm updating my review because I since got an estimate for a new system from Honest Air Care. Now, the quote for the new unit itself seemed reasonable, except that their warranty did not include a warranty on labor, which should be included on a $9,000 job unless there are specific extenuating circumstances that would preclude it. While Honest Air Care seems highly competent in terms of their knowledge and technical skill, at the labor rates that they quoted, if I were to require a repair under warranty (which does happen relatively often), the labor would not be included and could be quite costly. So far, what I see many HVAC companies doing - not just Honest Air - is charging extremely high rates for labor. For example, $150 to replace a 20 foot section of thermostat wire that is very easy to access? Come on! 5-strand thermostat wire costs 50 cents/foot at Home Depot and this install would take a maximum of 30 minutes if 1 person has to climb up and down to attach the wire from the thermostat to the AC unit! There wasn't even drywall that it would need to be ""fished"" through. So, giving the benefit of the doubt, that means a $300/hour labor rate? I realize that these companies have overhead, such as insurance, licensing, employee salaries and benefits, office space, vehicles, etc., so I understand that they have to charge enough to cover all that and still make a decent profit, but I still do not see how that can justify such high labor prices. There is definitely a niche open in HVAC for a company that does not overcharge for labor.",neutral

"With powerhouse collaborations to the likes of master chef Susur Lee and 6ix god Drake, one would expect Fring's to be on the same level as these Toronto bred icons. Unfortunately, the restaurant falls quite short of its creators creativity and flavor.  Between 8 people, we were able to order a myriad of items from the menu including ribs, pasta, fries and dessert. The ribs were the best part of the order both flavorful and tender but wasn't anything standout.Β  Similarily, all other dishes were okay but lacked flair or a creative flavor profile which would make it memorable or different from chains like Joey's or Earls restaurant.Β  Perhaps the most disappointing item of the evening were the truffle fries. For over $20 for a small basket of fries, I was expecting a bigger punch of truffle 'umami' than just a very slight scent of truffle. In fact everything was so distinctly lacking in what I've come to expect from both Mr.Lee and Drake that I can't even recall any favorite dish of the evening.   Cost wise, expect to pay on the higher end. Value wise, I found Fring's very lacking since similar dishes can be found at chain restaurants for substantially lower cost. IMO walk a few blocks up and enjoy a great meal at Lee's instead.Β  giving this more than 2 stars because the ambiance and service was great.",neutral

"2 stars because the service is too casual for a upscale restaurant and the food is not outstanding for the price.   i mean to say the servers are not very dignified or well trained. in spite of there poor service i tipped them very well because i am a dignified customer. Restaurant is clean. The girls at the front are very helpful. Nothing much to write about the ambience as nothing is quite exceptional other than beautiful chandeliers all over the places. Server started to called me buddy, as if we are neighbors. that behavior belongs to smaller restaurants. I accept i did not order my prime rib right, but the correction made by the server is not professional enough. It's like pointing me out as if i dont know nothing about eating steak. Food is dropped on our table as if the other side of the restaurant is caught on fire. There is no gentle placement of the food on the table. Again they behave very casually. They should remember we pay for the ambience and service ethics too. We are party of three people and the table we sat at is quite big. Servers lack minimum common sense to bring in individual sauce cups instead they just left large sauce containers in the middle and we struggled to stretch across the table to dip meat. I have eaten at so many upscale restaurants so can easily differentiate .  we ordered 3 entrees , i ate Prime Rib and i will review about what i ate.  30% of the prime rib is filled with Fat. i like it but just saying. Beginning 10 bites are superb and then after chewy part starts. seriously prime rib suddenly turns into a chewing gum.  Not sure why the same experience did not last until the end. meat dipping sauces (4 different kinds) are so good, i recommend trying them all and stick with what you like the most. I personally liked Peppercorn , Wine based, garlic based sauce.  Huge Prime Rib portion, i ate 70% and packed 30% for my puppies. Overall food experience is better than service.    If you have money, Go ahead give it a try.  If you experienced fine dining earlier then think before you pick this place. You may not experience similar hospitality . Try it if you never experienced fine dining earlier , it will help you for comparision purpose.  Thanks for reading my review.",neutral

"For my fill of TexMex this is it.   I haven't been home since Xmas so I do miss, oh do I miss, El Chico's.   For OTB chips = 3.5 as they are served huge (the 1/2 of a tortilla style) and decent texture. No different that the Restaurant style in a bag from the grocery.  Salsa = 4.55. Why? It has bite. Spicy but not overwhelming. It showed me that I've been outside my LA heritage for quite some time as I am losing tolerance for the heat level. But it's cool~ I'll build up my palette again for this spice and Cajun spicy.   Service = 3. What I love: the chip and salsa guys drops his to do as soon as you sit. What I don't like....we were charged for tortilla's. So much for being new and not knowing anything because nothing was explained. But at least things were kind of prompt and not overly hovering.   Dinner = Ultimate Fajitas and that's a 4. To my surprise Shredded pork, zucchini, squash was included. It was almost as if we were having Hibachi but the veggies are cut thicker.   Specials = Yipppeee. Monday - Wednesday catch a deal.   They don't have Coke Freestyle here but seems like only one place in town even does. So, oh well.   The butter isn't real butter. It's margarine. I guess I've been spoiled by WIsconsin for so long that I forget butter may be a treat.

It being the time it was, I decided to get the NY Hot Dog.  And to my disbelief, it turned out to be a foot long.

"Spending two hours rallying really works up a girl's appetite, so I decided to come and try this place out, as I've been meaning to for awhile and been too lazy to leave my hermit cave of an apartment.  I ordered the Cooper's Burger and it was pretty good: grass-fed beef, pork belly, some fresh lettuce and a nice aioli to taste. The food was easily four stars and was pretty good.  The bathrooms are kept very clean (although, there's only one). The service is also pretty decent; I've seen some inconsistencies here about it and I was a little weary before I walked in, but I must've been lucky and came on a good day because my waiter and the manager were both quite friendly.  This place is pretty small and some of the seating is kind of awkward; I was placed inbetween two groups by myself when there was plenty of other seats elsewhere. I'm sure it might've been easier on the waiters, but it was just kind of weird to be seated next to a family and two guys talking about finances.  Also, the alcohol list is pretty nice; at least 3 pages on beer alone. Kind of hot, actually, even if I'm not huge on beer.  That said, it's a pretty affordable place, the service is relatively friendly if you come in on a good day, and it's got a nice view of the capitol. But I'd avoid bringing large groups of people and kids--don't think this is a good place for either.",neutral

"After objectively evaluating this place in my head, I gotta stick ya with a three... maybe I'm a burger snob... maybe I'm too spoiled by the absolute majesty that is Lunchbox Laboratory here in Seattle... but when it comes down to it... the burger was just good. Nothing to really write home about and pretty pricey when it all comes down to it. I ordered the Nom Nom Burger, a Kobe beef patty with cheese and potato chips... it was good... but I'd rather call it the Nom Burger... definitely not deserving of the double Nom and far from the OmNomNoms majesty that is Lunchbox Laboratory.  Their spiked milkshakes were super good. But that really wasn't enough to push the score higher.  The ambiance is fantastic though, a great vibe, excellent service, but then again... I come to expect that in Vegas... so this ends up being a wash... it's all about perspective ya dig?  I don't believe I'd go again... but thanks for the treat and really... it wasn't bad...

I got here to buy my ticket early and was really disappointed in the atmosphere of the theater entrance- it was kind of depressing. No ticket machines, somewhat awkwardly placed ticket booths, and complete desolation other than the people in the ticket booths. Also, what is very annoying is that they don't take debit cards. Be forewarned! Credit cards and cash only, but there are two RBC ATMs in the entrance, so that is convenient. Seats in the theaters are very very comfortable but the reason I would give them three stars out of five is because the hard plastic back makes it so that you will hit your head on it if you want to rest your head back. I did as soon as I sat down and it was a real damper on the feeling of great comfort I felt as my butt hit the cushion. A good theater, but they can improve here and there!",neutral

At the front desk the guys were super nice, informative and overall you could tell they really enjoy their jobs.  After signing the waiver and putting in my protective gear, I was on the track ready to go.   Overall the experience was fun but not something I would do on the regular. The cars go super fast. If you have a need for speed you will love it (my bf did). The wheel is stuffer than a regular car so it takes dime getting used to.

"While visiting Las Vegas I was eating at the Fremont Hotel's Seafood Fantasy Buffet on Tuesday night with my family..........a few hours later (into the evening), one of my family members experienced projectile vomiting, & ungodly nonstop diarrhea from eating at the Fremont Hotel's Seafood Fantasy Buffet!   The next day when it was time to eat again, there was no way that we were gonna do any buffet!  Had to look for something to take out, and something light for my loved one, so off I went to the little Chinatown area on Spring Mountain Road.........I found this rather large Chinese restaurant called - Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant.  In I walked, and the first thing I asked them is if they sold juk (Chinese porridge)?  Lucky for me this was our savoir! I was able to get the juk that I wanted for my loved one, it was rather expensive, but when you need it, you need it!  This place offered seven types of juk -  1. Frog Leg Porridge  -  $19.00 for Large 2. Seafood Porridge - $17.00 for Large 3. Fish Porridge - $17.00 for Large 4. Fisherman Porridge - $17.00 for Large 5. Pork Porridge - $12.00 for Large 6. Chicken Porridge - $12.00 for Large 7. Beef Porridge - $12.00 for Large  I ended up ordering the Fish Porridge...........it was the perfect thing to have, when you have a loved one ailing from a queezy stomach.",neutral

"Coming here with some coworkers as part of Summerlicious, we decided to take advantage of their set menu. Located steps from Union Station Canyon Creek is situated a row of quite popular restaurants and bars. Taking the steps 'down' to the restaurant, the venue is quite spacious with its bar and dining area kept separate.  For starters I decided to try their Tuna Tostada, 4/5 well presented, fresh slice of Tuna served on a Taco chip with a mango and ginger glaze. great starter with bang of flavor!  The entree was 2.5/5 Peruvian crispy chicken bowl served with shredded veggies, guacamole, cilantro, peanuts and sesame drizzled with a lemon caper vinaigrette. Overall dish was OKAY, but had a kick of spice. the Chicken could have been marinated longer if anything.  For dessert I tried their banana coconut cream pie served in a glass cup with layers of coconut cream custard, slice of banana and toasted coconut shavings on top...great way to end a meal. 3.5/5.",neutral
"I used to eat at the one in uptown pretty often because I used to work up there so when I found out that they were opening a matthews location, I was super excited. They are one of the few Mexican restaurants that we've been to out here in NC that actually has good salsa. My husband and I are born and raised from CA and were used to eating Mexican food at least 3 times a week. Most of the places out here have salsa that tastes like ketchup. I really like their al pastor tacos in the uptown location. Unfortunately, I don't feel like the matthews location is up to par with the uptown location. Both times I've been here the meat in my tacos have been cold. First time I got the fried fish taco, and two al pastor tacos and today I got a chicken, braised beef, and carnitas taco and they all had luke-warm/cold meat. I'm also not a huge fan of their rice, but that's not a big deal.",neutral

"On our way home from the White Tank Regional Park, we stopped by Dillon's KC BBQ to pick up food to go. We called to place our order before we left the park, and the food was ready when we arrived.   The woman on the phone was very helpful. We had three people ordering pork ribs with different sauces, sides and drinks. The ribs are prepared with a rub which might be a problem for those on a no/low sodium diet. My dad tried to get the ribs without the rub, and had to forego the ribs entirely because the waitstaff said no ""rub"" was not an option. She was courteous and repeated the overwhelming offerings when we asked. Best yet, she got our order right.   The parking lot is huge! Be sure to park by the restaurant door and not the wildlife zoo door; otherwise you'll have a long walk. It would have been fun to eat here to enjoy the wildlife viewing after dining, but we had our dog and couldn't leave her in the car. Unfortunately they don't allow dogs on the patio either.   The ribs were finger licking good. The corn on the cob is boiled not grilled, so each morsel is very plump and juicy. The steak fries were cold by the time we got home. Definitely not a good item to order to go. My mom was smart and got the baked potato instead. It was wrapped in cellophane so it stayed warm.   I certainly would consider ordering the ribs again. They were tender, and I really enjoyed the ""sweet with heat"" sauce.",neutral

"My mother loves this place. I personally find it weird that you buy an uncooked pizza then heat up your house baking it... (This is Arizona folks!) but it is I guess a decent idea if you don't mind cooking it yourself. They are pretty generous with the toppings and the toppings seem fresh and of good quality.  Our family favorites are the chicken artichoke and the Mediterranean. However, I am generally underwhelmed by customer service everytime I have been in Papa Murpheys. Just last night, my mother, my husband, and I went in to get a pizza and asked about the specials. Basically they gesture to the two signs... for our reading pleasure... (instead of, you know, advising us what the specials are).  And we end up getting a deep dish meat lovers pizza that was on special... for $14 for a family size not bad- but not something we would usually choose-- and when we leave and are driving home we see a $5 for large pizza deal on a sign one of their employees was holding outside on the street- which they never told us... really?! The truth is we probably would have bought a couple large pizzas instead. We also bought the s'mores dessert pizza and the cheesy bread. Which ended up being buy one ($4) get one side for $2 (a special we weren't told about until we checked out- but hey, I guess better late then never).  So that customer service glitch aside... The meaty deep dish pizza was quite tastey and filling. The cheesy bread had way too little cheese and was just okay- definitely would not purchase again. And the s'mores dessert pizza was actually quite tasty when it came out of the oven when it was all gooey with chocolate and marshmallow goodness- and it disappeared the fastest- no suprise there. :) So, all in all the pizza is pretty good and fresh but this is just not a place my husband and I go to ever on our own- we just don't love it like others seem to. We just get it when we visit my parents because my mom loves it. But I do feel it is worth a try. Just work on the customer service piece a bit more.",neutral

"The Library is quintessential Carson Street - a crowded, noisy restaurant full of local twentysomethings and a menu full of bar food. What makes it unique is its pseudo-intellectual theme. The walls and windows are lined with dusty hardcover classics, and the menus are printed in vintage picture books. Menu items are named for literature greats, with titles like Edgar Allan Potatoes and The Fairest Fowl.  This effort at individualism makes me prefer The Library to other run-of-the-mill South Side bars. It's nice not to constantly experience the same sports-oriented, testosterone-driven atmosphere. The food isn't great but it's not bad either, and definitely hits the spot after a night of drinking. Another perk of The Library is that the kitchen is open until 1am, significantly later than most area establishments.   My top criteria for a great dining experience is that al fresco seating be available in the warmer months. Not only does The Library provide ample sidewalk seating, but it has a sweet roof deck! If you're in the area and are in the mood for some ""Ginger and Fried Pickles"" I'd recommend checking it out.",neutral

I had the Hanger Steak as an entree, probably the best Hanger Steak I've ever had. But at $50, I wouldn't have minded settling for something at Mon Ami.  I finished with the White Chocolate Mousse with Chocolate Pearls. It reminded me alot of Mon Ami Gabi's.   The drinks were nice, but nothing special. I got the raspberry mojito which didn't have enough flavor and kick to it. The wine decent, but I paid $12-18 per glass!  Overall, it was good but not worth the price tag.

"Went there on a Sunday evening with my boyfriend, took about an hour from arrival to receive the food. We got the vegetarian plate (vegan) to share, it was great.

Went another time with 2 other people, we planned to share one plate since it was a friend's first time and we weren't that hungry. 3 different people took our order within the our between our arrival and after being seated. We were then approached by an older woman who said we had to order another plate since there's 3 of us. I told her we'd already placed the order 3 times and had been waiting there for over an hour and no one mentioned anything. She then left and sent over a younger woman, with dyed light brown hair maybe about 45-50 years old, who was extremely rude and told us we had to order another plate or leave. There was another table of 5 sharing two plates. We pointed it out and she said ""they are paying taxes (???)"". We asked why no one had mentioned anything since we had ordered and waited so long and she said ""If you don't wanna wait why don't you leave? Leave then.""

"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(264/365) ""The Keiki Bowl""  Last time I set foot in this place was when Ric Guerrero was opening up Slidin' Thru Northwest. Braddah's has taken over with their ""Hawaiian Style Chipotle"" concept. The first time I tried Braddah's on Rainbow, I got a loaded burrito with Huli-Huli and Pulehu Steak, but the flavors of the meat got lost in all the toppings and the tortilla lost its chewiness and got solid real quick.  This time I was gonna get a bowl....no tortilla, minimal toppings and Huli-Huli Chicken.  I kept it simple...Huli-Huli, Brown Rice, and Corn. What really bummed me out this time was the tiny size of the TRAY, not a BOWL that Braddah's uses, and the Keiki(kid) portion sizes given. Chicken tasted like Chipotle, but smaller pieces, not Huli-Huli Chicken. and my already small container was only two thirds full! I was already regretting not going to the other places who do sell bowls at similar prices around the area(Chipotle, Zaba's, T-Mad, etc.) and their bowls do fill me up for the same price or a tad bit more.  Yeah, the bark is bomb, but something that's easily duplicated at home. If you're coming in for a meal, I would suggest dining in, they probably give you more. ALOHA!!!

"The only buffet option within the Suncoast Hotel.   The dinner is reasonably priced if you're not particularly looking for something.   Saturday night is prime rib and shrimp scampi. Not the greatest but not the worst either.   The other stations are so so.   If you have a comp then this would be four stars. If you had to pay, it's more of a two and a half but the service that you'll receive rounds it up to three stars and I feel that's fair.   The plates are cleared the moment you're finished and the drinks are topped off.   The dining area is comfortable. The seats and booths are well placed.   The only thing that I didn't like we're the extendable dining tables as they were a bit wobbly and silverware kept falling.  The desserts were decent but not many options to choose from.   The ice cream wasn't dryers which I prefer and the consistency wasn't right. It's probably their settings. I still finished it though.   At the end of the day, what it came down to was I came in hungry and left full.

"Car Sales: I have purchased 2 cars from VW South, not because of the customer service but because I love VW's and I knew what I wanted. My first VW was purchased from VW South in 2006 at this time the sales rep was very kind, professional, and not pushy. This past year I purchased a 2013 VW Beetle and truthfully I did care for the sales rep at all. Actually my husband and I left the lot because we did not care for him and his sales style and I decided to do my shopping online instad. Once I found what I wanted from their lot I called VW South to verify that they had it in stock and told them that I would be up that afternnon to purchase the car. Thankfully the sales rep that I did not care for was not working that  day and I did not have to interact with him then a week or so later I received a thank you letter from him for purchasing the car. I think this guy got credit for my sale when he did not deserve it but I guess that's how car sales work, the first person that approches you and gets you to give him your name or number ""claims"" the sale??? Service Department: I ordered racing stripes from VW to go across my new 2013 VW beetle. The sales manager that I worked with (I believe his name was Mike) arranged for them to get installed. The instalation was not great, I have some bubbles and riges in the stripe that I did not notice when I first picked the car up. Everytime I take my car to get washed and hand waxed I hear that my stripes were not installed correctly. When I took my VW up to the service department I spoke with the sales manager that sold me the stripes and he told me that an outside company came in to install the stripes for me and I needed to speak with them about the problem. I explained to the sales manager that I purchased the stripes from VW South and I payed VW South for the instal and I would think that VW South would contact the company that put them on for me to take care of the problem. The sales manager then agreed to call the company for me and said he would call me back about it. A year later I still have not heard back from the sales manager about this and my stripes are still not correct. I could follow-up again with them about this but I honestly dont think I will get it resolved. Yesterday we had to take our 2007 Jetta to the service department bc the trunk keeps popping open by itself and this is causing the battery to die. From the start when I spoke with Tracy from service department on the phone I felt as if she was ""in defence mode"" from the begining when I was just trying to explain to her what the problem was. Tracy went on to tell me that they may not be able to figure out the problem is if it does not occur while the car is with them and it is going to cost me $105 per hour that they spend looking. She said we can put a new latch on the trunk or try to replace parts but it can get expensive because they were not sure what it could be. I decided to leave the car with they anyway when we webt back to pick it up and walked back in the service department the lady at the first desk was sleeping at her desk and as we walked up to Tracy's work area several people in her office laughing with their phones out like they were on FB and quickly put their phones away when they saw us walk up. Tracy greeted us and said that they had ""just finished"" with the car and they could not find anything wrong with it. My husband went on to try to explaine to the service guy (David) exactly what was going on with the car. David said he had never heard of this and when my husband started to tell him some info that he found out about the problem on a VW form Tracy cut in and said ""He has been reading those forums"". My husband got upset with Tracy for cutting him off and let her know that he was upset. So as of now we do not know what the problem is and we are out $105. Tracy did offer to let us bring the car back 3 days later so David could work with it again and call VW Tech support but because we now question some of the employees and managements integrity we will probably change different VW dealer for service work.",neutral

"I recently returned in a simular situation as my last visit. The wait staff were, again, attentive, and three dishes were placed on each table. However, I was not as impressed by their food this time.  We started off with the pappadom as an appetizer. Although it had a heavy herb taste, it was also very salty. The chutneys alleviated this somewhat, but I still wasn't a fan. Then, we had chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, tarka daal, and chana masala served with naan and rice.   My first impression of the chicken tandoori was, again, salty. The chicken itself was well-cooked, and it would've been great with a bit less salt. I found the other three dishes okay, but the chana masala was the only one with any distinctive taste, and even that was mostly spiciness. (Thankfully, it was at a level well within my tolerance.) I didn't find any of them to be great, though. The naan was delicious, as was the rice, which seemed to have another light flavor from herbs or something.   For dessert, we finished off with kheer, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Overall, it's a nice, cozy restaurant, but I think there are better Indian restaurants in the area.",neutral

"First visit to Mickie's Dairy Bar - found parking nearby. Note: CASH ONLY establishment (ATM on site). Greeted right away and sat immediately. This was just after 9:00 am and today is a move in day for students, I know from driving past Mickie's for the past 15 years, you can almost always expect a 20-30 minute wait. Server greeted us with ice water right away and then brought me a hot cup of coffee, which was tasty and fresh. After a couple minutes to decide, we both ordered the most popular scrambler and the server also suggested a piece of their famous coffee cake which today was apple cinnamon or blueberry - we chose apple cinnamon. The coffee cake came out warm and delicious in just a few minutes, so we enjoyed that while they cooked our scramblers. The scramblers arrived and the plate was full. This is a dish made for a Badger Offensive Lineman - as the server said while refilling the coffee... ""slow and steady..."" - definitely needed a couple to-go boxes.

"It's been several months since I went to Sweets Raku, and I've been contemplating on how to review them. Do I follow the crowd and rate them high because it's almost expected of a place like this? Or do I find fun along with the faults?   First, it's an experimental experience. Desserts crafted here can be found nowhere else. They focus on creating sweets with laboratory precision with artistic style. Different flavors, colors and textures stimulate the senses.   My personal experience & observations:   Inside is bright, clean and modern. A glass wine cellar holding dozens of dessert wine serves as a wall by the entrance, guiding customers along the wall, where people just wait their turn. As you inch closer, there's a menu on the wall for you to study. Along the wall are cookies, macarons and other bite sized goodies for sale. Dozens of small tea canisters line the wall for an artistic display.   Tables are slow to be cleared for the waiting customers. Some sit there dirty for 10 min before anyone comes to clean it.  When we were next to be seated, the entire bar seating section of 8 was open, until a staff broke a glass on one end. They didn't seat anyone for more than 10 minutes because they took their sweet time.    Once seated, our orders were taken fairly quickly.  We asked for water, then we were told they automatically serve it to everyone.  Then I wondered why people who were seated after us got their water, and desserts before we did.  There's no order.   Each person is required to order a minimum of $12.  With a price of $15. for a dessert creation, it wasn't hard to achieve.  There's also a dessert set for $18., which includes a main dessert and a seasonal, which is basically a small scoop of sorbet that usually costs $5.   We ordered one set of the Carib and mango sorbet w mint jelly ($18), and one Mars ($15) The sorbet was hard to share, because it's about the size of one spoonful, topped with mint flavored jelly that really didn't go with the mango.  The Carib was served in a large glass, covered with a white choc lid. While served, they poured hot mango sauce over it to melt the lid into onto the other ingredients. The contrast in flavors and textures does get mixed up, but it worked.  Though I don't feel it's worth $15.     The Mars was served in a shiny red sphere. Vibrant color and perfectly round. FlambΓ© brandy is then poured over to melt the sphere, revealing the inside concoction.  Though pretty and highly photogenic for social media, the flavor did not work, and was ruined by the brandy. Also not worth $15.    The service by the entire staff was not impressive whatsoever.  Only one Japanese girl thy seated us managed to crack a small accidental smile.  A tall guy who assisted the pastry chefs had no facial expression nor personality.  The chefs themselves seemed very much in work mode and not personable at all to any of the patrons who undoubtedly came to see their creations in amazement.  While we were being served, a very brief description was announced and they did it bother to wait for any questions or photo ops. Luckily I observed how they were with others so I had my camera ready.    In my opinion, if a business will charge this price point, make us all wait standing in line, and they seem to take their sweet time cleaning tables, at least give us an experience of decent, friendly service and not act like his is some type of swanky, snobby Hollywood elitist hangout.    I may be back just out of curiosity, but not in any hurry, and know also not to expect any friendliness.  The 3 Stars is solely for creativity and the modern interior. I am not rating them higher based on the hype, or because everyone else raves about this place. Speed and level of service is def a 2.    See my photos & videos for menu, descriptions, interior and desserts.",neutral

"Got off work and really craving for a korean/hawaiian bbq. Came across this on yelp so i went to have an early dinner since its the nearest kbbq from work. Went in, it was quite busy. an old lady greeted me while she was cleaning tables. But she didnt really say if I should just get a table myself or wait for someone to have me seated. After about 2mins of standing there, i finally came up to her while she was still cleaning a table and ask, she was like ""for here to go?"" I said for here and she said, oh ok please have a seat (while pointing on a table for 4 on the corner). Sat down and a young lady came up, gave me the menu, and ask what I wanna drink. Her smile was very welcoming so I forgot about the earlier incident. A minute later an old man came up and brought my water, convincing me to try their iced tea instead. But no thank you, im good with iced water. He was very friendly and the whole time i was there, he kept checking on me, but never refilled my water. As for food, food is ok. A little pricey. I ate by myself but i felt like I paid for two. I had the combo which has kalbi, meat jun, and chicken that comes with white rice and mac.. Banchan doesnt have my fish cakes! Huhu. Banchan only consists of kimchi, cucumbers, and bean sprouts. I was so sad. I want my fish cake and tofu! lol. I didnt finish all the meat jun and chicken so i asked for a to go box. The old man came back with a to go box full of rice and he said ""for your dinner"" how nice of him! I wanna give this place 4 stars at least, but the food is too pricey, ive had kbbq on same average of taste and quality or better.

"This is a good example of a Las Vegas original: A ""locals pub."" These are places to drink, eat, watch sports and gamble (sorry, I mean ""game"") all at once, or just do one or the other of the above...and either with groups of friends, a date, or just by yourself. Mulligans meets these expectations well with solid, consistent food and service. Seems to be a favorite with local law enforcement, since whenever we drive by, there's usually one or two police cars parked there (for the food, of course, as it's a safe neighborhood!)  Mulligans is not too much to look at on the outside, but inside you can either head left to the bar area or right to the restaurant area, both decorated in Southwestern style, with cool movie posters and Western memorabilia on the walls and TV's to watch Sunday football on. In our visits, we've only been to the restaurant side, but people on the bar side look like they're having fun watching sports and playing video poker.  What you look for in a locals pub in terms of food is what you get at Mulligans- standard bar food with your typical appetizers, hamburgers, sandwiches, salads, pasta and breakfast items with a couple of cool twists (try the breakfast burrito or the Cobb salad to see what I mean.) Plus, if you are like me, the type of person who needs hash browns, not ""breakfast potatoes"" with your eggs and bacon, they've got that here, unlike some other locals pubs. We've been there for breakfast and lunch and there are various specials (both food and drink) depending on when you are there. But even at full price, it won't break the bank.  Being a locals pub, you can expect mostly good service with the occasional off-day- once when we were there, the waitress took forever to notice us and took a while to take our order and return with drinks...and then she got the order wrong. But the other times we've been, service has been good and the wait staff is definitely helpful and friendly.  Three stars rather than five because neither the menu nor beer selections are as broad as at other locals pubs and having been there a few times now, we've not had to really look hard to choose our favorite items, but for a place with consistent service and well-executed standard fare, it's a good place to have in your rotation.",neutral

Many years ago I got into an argument with someone claiming he was the owner about discriminatory practices while his two doberman pincers jumped all over me.  They aren't licensed as a private club yet they operate as one.     I used to really like the selection of merchandise in years past.  Now they  have 2X the space and use it on things that don't interest me like salon services and dance classes.  I don't know if they have changed ownership or buyers or both.

"My favorite place to see a movie, despite any kitchen hiccups.  Kitchen & bar are not on the ball 2nd night in a row.  If you order extra items on your pizza, 50/50 they'll be thrown on AFTER it comes out of the oven.  Even if if you ask, the kitchen insists on adding your items AFTER the cheese, so they fall off when you pick up a slice.  Makes me think pizza isn't made to order.  Kitchen is much better mid-week.

"REI has always been a store that has quality items.  In Berkeley I enjoyed the exploring the large store, that had everything.  In Seattle tis easy to get lost in the three stories, and in Portland tis in the Pearl District, and they are far larger than the small stores in Las Vegas.  I have used REI, as my Bicycle shop because of the knowledge of the mechanics.  I have taken the road bike classes every other year as refreshers in the early months of the year.  I seem to always be on my bicycle on Saturday or Sunday ride when passing close to REI, with its easy to reach location in the District at Green Valley Ranch in Henderson, NV (South west of Green Valley & 215 intersection).  The Bicycle Shop has always been wonderful to stop for parts or upgrades, but recently there are few qualified mechanics.  There are helpful staff that can sell your items, but no one with knowledge on what you need, or will it work on my bicycle with this crankset?  I still do not have a chain catcher installed, on all my bicycles.  Seems the store needs to hire more qualified staff to replace the staff that has moved along.  For my bicycle needs I have gone to a competitor, as the one mechanic left can not be there all day long 7 days a week.  The last three times i needed repair there was no one qualified was scheduled in the bicycle shop for hours.  Maybe this will change soon, but February and March 2013 it has been a waste of time for me, and my bicycles.    I can only hope this is a temporary condition for this easy to reach location improves rapidly,.  JR",neutral

"When we knew were going to be in town for a while I did some Yelp-Search to find a place to eat for lunch. Being particularly fond of the hamburger, we found a couple of locations that really looked good. In the interest of full disclosure the first place we went to was closed for renovations. I had actually planned on getting a burger at both places so we were going to go to Dotty's anyhow. Dotty's was busy when we arrived and we have about a 20mn wait. Not bad at all and usually a good sign when a place is busy. We had already done our homework and knew what we wanted to order. I ordered the Pub burger with fries, my wife wanted to save herself for a special dinner and only went with the fried pickles.  Our order arrived pretty quickly. I hit my burger right away. While my burger was cooked perfectly, the cheese was not melted. Munster cheese is usually a pretty good cheese to use for melting and this was not melted. My burger was supposed to have bacon and I don't recall seeing any bacon. Maybe it was cut up, just didn't stand out. While my burger was good, I felt it was missing some of the fat and goodness that I crave with a burger. The fries were good and I took every opportunity to dip them in what tasted like homemade ranch dipping sauce that came with my wife's fried pickles. The fried pickles by the way were very good. The pickles tasted homemade. They were crispy and the ranch dipping sauce was a perfect compliment. Dotty's has a lot of burgers and I would totally be up for trying some of their other burgers. Dotty's is an old school place and had I gone to school in Madison, I'd be there a few nights a week and on the weekends for a burger and a beer.",neutral

"I've been to the Sushi Samba in Miami, and if I had to choose, I'd be in Miami in a heartbeat. The menu is interesting, and the variety is solid, but I wasn't impressed with the sushi.  The fish was fresh, but not cut well, and the rice was less than stellar.  The space is broken down into cool loops, so you can feel like you're in an intimate place, but take a look at the walls before you end up at a business meeting under the kabuki ""adult toy"" mural.    I was there with a pretty large group, and I can understand that food may come out a bit slowly.  However, they lost drink orders, which is a cardinal sin for a place with a bar menu that is as big as it is.  The little bites were tasty, and the few bits of Brazillian food that we had were solid. Not amazing, as there are much better ways to do a Brazillian steakhouse kind of menu, but no complaints on that.    What was good?  The environment and the drinks.

The ratio of carb to protein and fiber was disproportionate. I think I would have given it more stars if there were more veggie and protein to offset the amount of carbs. All in all, it was very tasty!! And I would definitely dine here again.  The service here was great! The staff here was very friendly and perhaps one of the nicest people we have met at a restaurant.

"We visited Planet Hollywood right after it opened several years ago and were totally wowed.  As is true for most things in Vegas, however, it has not worn well.  For example, the Roman shade in our room was jerry-rigged open with a hanger from one of the closets.  Classy.  All that said, the price was fair, the location was decent.  They just opened Gordon Ramsey's BURGR restaurant, which was pretty good; very generous dinner for two with appetizers, entrees, sides and dessert for $60.  Expect a younger crowd, and if you're even remotely serious about your gambling, expect that younger crowd to be an utter disappointment at the tables.  They can screw up a game of blackjack without even blinking, and then wonder why the rest of the table is giving them the stinkeye.",neutral

"We thought this would be a special place to take out of town guests for a Christmas celebration before they left for home.  It was a disappointment in many ways. The restaurant was freezing!  We were by the thermostat (59 degrees) and it never climbed beyond  60 degrees the whole time we were there. Also, we made reservations and our table was across from the kitchen door and by the service station.  I asked for another table but was told the others had been reserved.  What?  So we ordered drinks hoping to warm up!  The service staff was very friendly if a little hurried so the drinks were fine.  Food was ok but nothing special.  A very expensive experience and disappointing since our daughter and her friend were visiting for the holidays.  We should have dined somewhere else.   On the positive side, we would go back and have a drink in warmer weather and enjoy the city view.  If you are looking for great food, this is not the place.

After over an hour wait we were finally seated-I get that it was a busy Sunday afternoon on a beautiful day but really! Next it took our party of 6 over 45 minutes to get our meal. It was nice to enjoy the view of the lake outside on the deck but we were melting by the time our meal came.  I was hoping for Sunday brunch but I guess they stop the breakfast menu at 11-geeze they really cater to those early morning bikers.  I went with the BLT which also came with avocado and a fried egg. It was very tasty and I do like that you were able to pick your choice of a side, I went with the fruit which was just ok.  The prices were high but I guess you are paying for the view.

They do have a decent number of vegetarian choices but the menu on the night I was there was fairly meat-heavy. I am going to come back and try brunch next time as the menu looks ever so promising.

Their menu offers a wide variety so it appeals to vegetarians, meat/burger lovers, those looking for smaller portions, and even has some good looking desserts as well. I had the waldorf chicken salad, which was pretty good. The baked apple crisps were a unique change from the norm. My husband had the 2 am burger, which comes with a fried egg, bacon and hashbrowns - it was a nice, thick burger and really appeals to you if you are hungry. The fries were ok - nothing special.

"Blanco is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants; my girlfriend and I go nearly every other week for drinks and some food after work. The food here is great! An awesome high-end Mexican taco spot! The elote is delicious as well as the drinks! If you are looking for a fun hip taco spot and don't mind paying a little more this is the spot to go, typically 5 stars from me! I love all the Fox restaurants but this day might have changed my opinion of Blanco. On October 17,2017 we went to Blanco and the whole restaurant had changed it's design. The menu had been updated and when we ordered our typical favorites, they tasted noticeably different and were not up to our expectations. Also on this particular visit, the food had cooled down by the time it reached our table, which made it even less enjoyable.  Every time we go to Blanco I usually order the carne asada burrito. My girlfriend usually orders three street tacos, carnitas, bbq pork and chipotle shrimp. Her favorite was the chipotle shrimp. She substituted the typical rice for street corn and thought it was good too. I got the black beans and rice to go along with my burrito. Generally, we love the food. However, we've recently noticed some inconsistencies. As I previously stated, the menu was recently updated at the Scottsdale location and the food seemed inferior to the norm. Also, we stopped by while we were on a trip to Tucson and each received substantially undercooked carne asada, which left us dissatisfied and without appetites. Although the service is usually friendly and accommodating, as with most Fox Concept Restaurants I've tried, this time around they were not as willing to help. When we pointed out the undercooked carne asada, the server brushed it off and did not offer for our meals to be recooked.  The atmosphere is one of my favorite aspects of the restaurant. I love to go during the NBA playoffs because the crowd around the restaurant is really excited and you can feel the energy in the room.  The food is great; everyone is having a great time and the service is prompt and friendly, what more can you asked for. Each location of Blanco's is uniquely decorated, but all have a laid back beach vibe. All locations have indoor and outdoor seating that is accompanied by lively, colorful dΓ©cor. Of the locations I've been to, the restaurant seems to typically be focused around the bar and the kitchen is within view of customers which also contributes to the laid back atmosphere of the restaurant.   The food at Blanco is priced fairly with most entrees ranging between 12 - 20 dollars. The drinks are slightly more expensive with most cocktails being about $10 each. I like to go during happy hour when there are some food and drink specials. The sangria is a must, and on happy hour a carafe which can get you about 4 glasses is only $18 which ends up being only $4.50 per glass. Overall, I would recommend Blanco! Although we have had a couple less than ideal visits, the restaurant usually has great food, good prices, and friendly service.",neutral

"My friend was right! The Mahi fish tacos are pretty good! They are grilled so you don't feel as bad about eating them. The firecracker shrimp tacos have a little kick in the flavor, but they are definitely not spicy.  I ordered hurricane rice instead of fries to go with the seafood tacos, but I guess the waitress forgot to tell them, so I ended up with fries. The regular fries were overcooked and lacked taste. It was a strange texture because once you bit into the fries, there was a crunch but it seemed like nothing was inside the fries. My other friend got the sweet potato fries, which I didn't know was even available, and that was much better than the regular fries. I'm not sure if it's always this way with the fries, or we just tasted the regular fries on a ""bad"" day, but just to be sure, I'm going to order the sweet potato fries next time. I should probably try the wings next time, since that is in the title of their restaurant/bar, but I didn't want to have buffalo chicken wing breath before going back to work. I like this place though. This was my second time back.",neutral

"Vanilla bean cheesecake was decadent and yummy but did not have a hint of vanilla bean flavor. The crust was also rock hard and literally impossible to put my fork through. I really don't understand the point of having such a rock solid crust. Chocolate chip cookie sandwich was soft and tasty. Salted caramel coconut macaroon was delicious (I love caramel and coconut) but was sorely lacking in salt. Salted caramel brownie was very fudgey and decadent! The champagne cupcake was very pretty but bland, did not taste like anything special. Wish they had more cupcake choices. My friends really liked the peanut butter chocolate cake and the birthday macaron. I feel like I tried a good variety of things and wasn't exactly amazed, especially at these prices, but I didn't hate it either. It's essentially just a cute place to take good Instagram pictures and eat something sweet.  Service was mediocre, cold and unfriendly.

"Went there last night with my companion.   We had the calamari appetizer with the aioli dip and tomato-based dip.   It was good but nothing spectacular to make it stand out.  I had the shrimp mediterranean and my companion the pasta brio.   The shrimp had a bit of a spicy kick to it just enough to give it the right flavoring.   It sat on a bed of orzo with an assortment of veggies.   I noticed it had an asterisk next to it, meaning the complete dish is under 700 calories.   That was good since we had just ingested the bread and calamari, and, quite frankly, I was full from that.   I tasted my companion's pasta.   It had chicken and was seasoned with a tomato-based sauce.    I don't normally like tomato-based sauces, but it was a light sauce, meaning it appeared to be mixed with something, and wasn't too much of a tomato taste.  The chicken had kind of a weird texture, almost seemed rolled type, but it didn't taste bad.   Just a weird consistency I couldn't put my finger on.  Our server was Ashley, and she was friendly and efficient.    I have  been here quite a few times for happy hours in the past.   It is a good spot for HH.    I would give it four stars for that.

Girls in crazy heels not watching where they're going, rolling 4-5 deep, too drunk and awkward on their heels to move in a graceful manner, and guys just, well there. * Upside, our room was low floor with a cr@p view but relatively quiet. Didn't hear any club noise - and only occasional noise from the room next door *I liked our room overall, nice size, comfortable bed, nice understated decor * Room wasn't QUITE as clean as I would have liked. Couch was dusty...wtf? I ended up putting towels across the seats. * Like many other hotels, we had to pay the resort fee, so we just used our WiFi like the wheels were going to fall off :) * Hubby's a picky eater so he wasn't feeling most of the restaurant options, until we got to the Wynn Buffet. I've never seen his eyes light up over food like that before. The buffet was awesome and a great way to end our trip. * I thought the location was going to be a huge minus being somewhat far up the street, but it was perfect. Great proximity to the bus stations (Fashion Mall(?) stop) so super easy to get the lower part of the Strip as well as Fremont Street.  I would easily have given this place 4 stars but the damned club kids knocked it down a star.",neutral

"There is no way this place can be healthy! But it was a hearty way to start off a busy work week. I had never been to a Cracker Barrel before. Crazy, right? The little shop was interesting. I didn't find anything that I just HAD to have, but there were some cute little things in there.   Now on to the restaurant. It seemed too crowded and I was a little unsure where to enter and exit the establishment. But overall the food hit the spot and I thought our server was very sweet. The dining experience was decent, but I think I'd rather opt for a less cluttered place with a healthier, menu full of local and fresh items in the future.",neutral

As far as food, it's Burger King!... I personally have not received anything bad, given the menu choices.. remember, it's Burger King. The service priority is my only grumble.

"Came to Toronto for a few days to explore (but mainly to eat) and hot pot was one of the first things in our checklist. Long story short, this place left a bitter taste in my mouth (literally).  Walked in with a group of 7 and were seated very tightly in a couch area when we easily could have sat in the round tables. This made for a VERY uncomfortable meal. Minus half a star.  We began ordering, but before we did, we had to order the Broth which was not a problem. I opted for the mild legendary spicy broth. I warn you, that the spicy broth isn't spicy because of the broth but because of the damned chiles and those weird balls on the bottom. I personally wasn't familiar with this because I've never had hotpot before (I know, right?) but being asian, I guess it was as if I would have been used to this? No one told me that if I ate the little balls with the chile on the bottom (which, apparently you're NOT suppose to?) that my entire mouth would become numb for several minutes. I ended up scooping out all the chile and the things on the bottom and diluted the crap out of it with water. So.. long story short; maybe opt for the broths that are NOT labeled the ""Legendary spice"" even if it says mild.   The food was very good. The vegetables, the meat, especially the lamb, beef and pork were delicious. The shrimp was fresh and juicy, I loved it all. The only thing that bothered me the most was the lack of attention to my table. My group and I were low on broth at least 2-3 times while we were there for 2 hours and never did a worker come by to pour more broth. I, was flabbergasted by the horrible service because we had to flag down waiters multiple times and they said ""it's coming"" and we proceeded to wait at least 15+ mins, while they checked their phones. Minus 1/2.  Another thing is that the workers failed to get our order and had forgotten it twice?? Like.. how? I mean, we gave them the slip with everything on it, but just had forgot to put it in.. twice. It took so much effort from my group to get at least decent service.. So this was a full star off.  The only thing that saves this place is the food. I really enjoyed everything that we ate and I hope that this was a one time thing so that if we ever come back, maybe the service will be better.",neutral

"I've stayed here twice (15 years between visits), and don't really feel the need to stay here again unless the price is too good to pass up. Pros: room was clean; bed was comfortable; location was great. Cons: no mini-bar, fridge, or other amenities; only one chair; a couple of broken lamps, and shower curtain rod broke while we were there. I did like the workout room and spa, but do NOT visit the salon (Uno) as they're rip-off artists. The rest of the hotel -- casino, stores, restaurants, etc. -- were all fine but not great. In summary: Fine place to stay if the price is right, but you can do better on the Strip.",neutral

"I'm used to Ranch 99 back in Northern California, and this supermarket wasn't anything spectacular. This is a good place if you want seafood! All of the traffic was around that area. The food from the take-out section didn't look too good.  The market also has the bakery, peking duck, the flattened 1/2 duck, and roasted chicken.   There is also Hong Kong Express to-go food where you can order noodles, dim sum, congee, boba drinks, rice dishes, etc. It's right next to the take-out food.   The most interesting part of the supermarket was the selling of Chinese pancakes in front of the store. You can order mini pancakes with either a red bean, coconut, or custard filling. Each pancake is made to order and is $.50 each. I tried both the custard and red bean pancakes and it was pretty good! Cash only payment for the pancakes. You also have to wait awhile for the pancakes since there is a long line.",neutral
"They have skinny mirrors!  I just wish I really looked as good in reality as I do in the mirrors at Everything But Water... but alas, even without skinny mirrors in real life, my mission to find a tankini type of bathing suit was accomplished after a quick visit to this EBW location.  Katy helped me out and was extremely helpful - especially considering she was the only one working during my visit.  Selection wasn't as amazing as I would have liked, but they supposedly have even more styles online.  They do have a good variety of colors, styles, prints, etc... and the beauty of this place is that you can purchase different size tops and bottoms if need be.  (Mix and match if you will.)  Prices were on the higher side as well, but sometimes a girl has to splurge, and that's what I did since I don't think I'd bought a new bathing suit since about 1999.  (Okay - I may be exaggerating a bit, but all of my bathing suits other than my new purchase are really old!)  If you're looking for a new suit, EBW is a great place to start!",neutral

"Went there with a client/friend the other evening.   It was rather noisy and busy and he thought we'd go somewhere else if we wanted to hold a conversation and actually hear each other.  After visiting the nearby Sprouts and doing a little shopping, he decided, nahhh.   Let's go to Babbo after all.  I was starving, so that was fine with me.   First I had to check out the bar menu.   What??  Tito's martini, $9??   I am so there!  Told the server how I wanted it:   shaken with ice, no vermouth, in a martini glass.   Perfecto!   As we perused the menu, we snacked on the warm bread (Yes, bread.  Remember?   I was starving!!) dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  We both ordered the Pomodoro Tomato.   I thought it was some kind of salad, like with lettuce, but I was informed, no, it was a tomato with mozzarella cheese, just like the menu says, with virgin oil, sea salt, and basil.  Huhhh?   He's Italian.   Therefore, he explained it to me.   Yummmmm!!   I wouldn't mind making that myself.   In fact, I think I shall for the next luncheon or dinner party I have.    I had the Great White Buffalo and he had the Babbo's Bowl O' Bolognese.   My pasta came with two big pieces of chicken.  Very creamy and tasty with the Gorgonzola Sauce.   It seemed rather paste like, as though there was maybe flour used.   I think it could have done away with that, albeit it was good.  Even though he professed not to be hungry, he did down his Bolognese and pronounced it to be very good.   I guess he was hungrier than he thought.  I would go back.   It is conveniently located.  The drink prices were perfect.   The service was friendly and accommodating.",neutral

"This is a popular place, so be forewarned if you plan on coming here on the weekends! Our party of three arrived at 12:30pm on a Saturday to find the place absolutely packed! We ended up having to wait almost 40 minutes before we were seated, or even truly looked at. While I understand that they're busy, the customer service could improve.  I ordered the three eggs (chose mine poached) and chose to pay an extra $3 to substitute homefries for fruit. I wanted to replace the toast, but apparently the fries and fruit are more expensive and ergo can only substitute each other. The poached eggs, poached medium, were heavenly. I was also given a sizeable amount of fruit - it was a pretty layout of alternating pineapples and orange slices. Yum!  My friend ordered the three eggs (sunny side up) with smoked Polish sausage and the homefries. I had some of hers... Delish! The other friend got the banana peanut butter waffle, which comes topped with whipped cream. It was utterly heavenly. The banana and peanut butter wasn't too sweet, but had the perfect pairing.  Our waitress was friendly, but you could tell that they were super busy and a little understaffed. Nevertheless, still a decent brunch place in Sauga City!",neutral

I had to use hummus and tahini to add some extra flavor.  I do have to saw, the Greek fries are superb.  It is a good size portion of fries with garlic sauce and feta cheese.

"I have ate at this creperie for a couple of years now. I actually just ate there two weekends ago. I really did not enjoy the crepes. First of all, the concept of this place is perfect. It is located in Paris near the buffet. You can actually watch them make the crepes. In some sort of a way, it is almost like art. The lady with the long pony tail did not make it like art. I know there were a lot of people and she was rushing, but she was kind of sloppy and throwing them all together really quick. I think if she took her time a little more and put a little more love in making them, that they would actually be better. The best part about the crepes is the menu. You have sweet and savory options. I had the monte cristo.I would of liked more cheese that was melted, less turkey and ham, and a more flavorful bechemel sauce. I would of liked more powdered sugar and more micro basil. But, it was decent.",neutral

The food from the snack bar was decent but I would have preferred to try one of the restaurants.   Seating, picking your seat is very nice because you for have to show up to the theater an hour early for a decent seat. The premium seats are the way to go because you get the wait service with them.

"Staying at the Mirage so I decided to give this place a try. Since I was going solo I decided to sit at the bar.

It's apparently brought to you on a skewer and put on a platter (I was at the bar so I got a platter of meat).   I order some ginormous drink called a Caipirinha (actually I had 2) and it kicked my butt pretty good. I went on to gamble away 50 bucks in the casino without hesitation and called it a night.   Anyway, the food was good, got a bit loud because of a group of frat boys, good selection of meats from chicken to lamb to marinated steak and some sides of veges (creamed spinach, carrots, rice & beans).

The rice was good but quite spicy so I suppose for those who like it spicy this is a good choice.  The potato salad was good but not so good that it left an impression.

"Thumbs up: good prices, a tad cheaper than some of the other options in the area. Fresh toppings and this spicy pickled something (garlic and eggplant maybe?) was especially good.  Thumbs down: Menu inside is quite different from the pamphlets they give out. Some of the options on the pamphlet aren't actually available (i.e. Donair (Beef &Lamb) wrap/sandwich  Schwarmas. How do you differentiate between them? Imho, you need some good, distinctive toppings. The main components of Lezzet's Chicken schawarma is good, but fairly run of the mill. The veggies were fresh and the sauces were mostly average. There was one topping, a spicy pickled veggie that was particularly distinctive, it added a nice kick to the pita, but it doesn't quite add enough to put this place over the top compared to Pita and Grill which is up the street. It's a toss up between the two.  The prices are a bit lower than other options in the area and the restaurant is clean. Chicken Schawamra pita came to $5.50 after taxes. See pictures for additional pricing.  If you're looking for it, it's in the corner of the plaza ACROSS from Rockwood mall.",neutral

"Just tried some take-out from here last night for the first time.  Got the chicken pad thai and the jumbo shrimp red curry.  First I just want to say, how lazy are these people that their ""jumbo shrimps"" aren't even de-shelled or de-veined at all?  The last thing you want to have to worry about at the dinner table is taking the digestive tract out of your shrimp and wiping it on the napkin beside you or whatever.  There is no excuse for this but sheer lazyness.  Also, another thai curry ruined by the ridiculous addition of green bell peppers.  This is NOT a thai ingredient and should not be in your curry.  Now with the bad out of the way, the rest of the food was pretty acceptable.  Pad Thai was the opposite of sweet and a little darker than I'm used to, makes me think they're using soy sauce in it, but the flavor works.  Curry was tasty, although not enough liquid and as I said, ruined by the gigantic chunks of bell pepper and un-prepped shrimp.  Next time I would order it with no bell peppers and change the shrimp to another protein.  I will give it another shot soon and report back.",neutral

"I absolutely love Mexican food, so I'm always on the lookout for restaurants like the Steel Cactus. Granted, I consider Steel Cactus a little lower on the quality scale than most other Mexican restaurants, but they have a great happy hour which my roommates and I frequent.   One of the things I really like about the Steel Cactus is the rooftop bar. This is such a fun place to be in the summertime, enjoying a fruity drink and looking out over Shadyside. As I mentioned, my roommates and I usually come for the happy hour, so I can't speak too much to the regular entrees. Concerning the happy hour - it's one of the best we've found in the burgh. They have a whole list of house wines (about six of them, I believe) that are $3 a glass...and they are pretty healthy pours! Additionally, all of the specialty cocktails are only $5. I appreciate this a lot as I enjoy getting cocktails but most happy hours only put one or two cocktails on special. I usually get the mojito; it's pretty good, and there aren't many other restaurants in the city that offer mojitos year-round.  On the food scene, all of the appetizers are half off which turns out to be a great deal when you come with a few friends. For example, the guacamole is usually $8, down to $4 at happy hour, and thus only a little over $1 per person if you come with two other friends. You can't beat that! My roommates and I LOVE dips, so we always go straight for the guacamole and the queso dip. The quesadillas with chicken are good as well. One of my friends is gluten-free, and she was easily accommodated by switching out the flour tortilla for a corn tortilla on the quesadillas.   Is this the best Mexican food I've ever had? Well, no, not by a long shot. But man, you can't beat the prices! If you're looking for delicious authentic Mexican food, the truth is that you probably want to look elsewhere. But the Steel Cactus is always a great choice if you're looking for a super cheap happy hour where you can share a few tasty drinks and apps!",neutral

"There's a lot of hate for the service at America, but I didn't have any issues. Everyone was quite nice and considerate. On decor - the restaurant is on the 31st floor of the Trump Tower, but the view isn't as nice as other roof top restaurants like Canoe or the Roof Lounge at the Park Hyatt. They dim the lights at night to a point where you feel like you're in a night club and there's a DJ in the back who puts out some good tunes. This was alright as we were heading to the club afterwards, but I can imagine some people taking issue with this.   We had a large group so we were able to sample a lot of the food on the menu. The food is hit and miss, but mostly miss. The appetizers and the dessert weren't that good. Some of the entrees, however, were quite nice. The highlights: - Whole Roasted Dover Sole (MP, ~$70 for us): you don't often find dover sole on restaurant menus so this was quite a treat. The fish was cooked and de-boned very well. Probably the best dish of the night. Note: they only serve this on Fridays.  - Tomahawk Rib Steak for Two ($150): if you start with high quality meat, it's hard to screw it up. Nonetheless, this tomahawk was good - cooked to the right temperature, tender and flavourful.  - Mac & Cheese side ($9): not an entree, but this side got quite a bit of attention at the table. It's more cheese than mac, so if you love cheesy mac & cheese, get this.  - Complimentary cornbread: not an entree, but this was so good we had to re-order it 3 or 4 times. They're fresh out of the oven and have a perfect amount of jalapenos for spice.   Of all the restaurants that I have called ""pricey"", this one probably sits near the top. It's not just the dollar amount, but the value of the food/beverages that you get for it. At America, it was way over the top. I would probably only return if I'm not paying for it or during Winterlicious/Summerlicious.",neutral

"Green goddess ($6.99) has an initial sweet taste from the juice but has a veggie aroma and leaves aweird veggie sweet bitterness on your tongue afterward. Not exactly a taste I'm used to but it's okay. The drink comes with a Vega one protien powder which is plant based instead of milk so, it is vegan friendly. I don't think the protien was fully mixed into the drink though cause I found a clump of it after finishing the drink. Butter coffee ($3.99) does have a rich buttery taste I can identify especially the aftertaste on the tongue. The butter flavour sort of makes the bitterness of the coffee tolerable. Every time, someone opens the door, the cold of winter goes straight through the cafe. There is no vestibule and the door closes really slow. There are approx 7 tables of seating in the cafe.

Korean Shrimp & Chicken Stick I don't know what's ""Korean"" about this, but the marinade was spicy.  The veggies were also very spicy and good.  The chicken could've been more juicy, but the overall dish was pretty good.  Smoked Salmon Bruschetta My fav item.  With pickled pink onions, tomato, capers, and olive oil.  Tangy, smokey, crispy.  Addictive!  36-Hour Pork Ribs Full rack of baby back ribs that are slow cooked for 36 hours and basted with sweet and spicy jalapeno and molasses sauce.  Served with fries and yummy coleslaws!  The sauce was very tasty, but there were some spots on the rib that were too salty for some reason.  Then there were other parts that weren't salty.  Perhaps the chef literally threw a handful of salt on the ribs!?",neutral

"My 10 year old self is upset with me for giving the Science Center a 3 star review, but my 21+ self was disappointed with the last evening event here.  To knock it out of the way, the 21+ nights are overpriced and the only benefit is the lack of children.  As a student, these nights are not discounted in any way, and you are coughing up $10 early-bird and $15 at the door.  Cocktails inside are $8-$10, and you are paying for food as well.  The 21+ nights have nothing new or especially engaging.  Plus, everyone does 21+ nights now, and the other museums are doing it for less.  CMOA charges $5-$10, and Phipps is doing it for free.  At least the Children Museum's nights let you make cool things to take home for $15.  Now that we've gotten that out of the way, there are some cool things for adults.  The miniature railroad and village area is awesome at all ages (Make sure to blow the train's whistle by pressing the big button about midway through the village.).  Building with the giant blocks has been popular in the past, and the Earthquake Cafe is always a favorite as well.  Make sure to ride the elevator too, as you get to see how that works from the inside.  The one thing I haven't found in recent trips is the weather station exhibit where you can be a weather person.  Is that gone?  The other floors gear to elementary aged-kids.  The water area/playground thingy on the top floor is usually a big hit, although anticipate wet children on the drive home.  If you are coming with kids, be aware that exhibits only half work semi-frequently.  The other thing is that the museum isn't as educational as one might think.  While some exhibits are hands on, things like the physics behind the robot playing basketball are never explained.  I might be hung up on this since my undergrad degree is in math, but I think the museum is lacking in scientific explanation sometimes.  This museum is a great way to spend an afternoon with a student in elementary school.",neutral

"So I went on a marathon 2 hour bike ride right before heading to Enrico's for the first time and on my last mile all I could think was ""iced caffe mocha, iced caffe mocha"" over and over again.  Did I mention that I forgot my water bottle on my ride too?  I was a desperate woman at the end of that one.  So I got home aired myself out and drove myself to Enrico's since a previous yelper mentioned she had the best iced caffe mocha there.  There was easy street parking right out front and I really liked that it was nestled in the middle of a neighborhood and not a loud crowded street.  Tables are large enough for good work space and folks had their laptops out inside enjoying the free wifi while the tables outside were filled with friends.  So why the 3 stars?  Well the iced caffe mocha was a bit subpar.  The syrup was all at the bottom leaving my first couple sips very watery.  Could have been a better mix.  Would I give this another try?  Sure but I definitely will ask for a nice hard shake of my iced caffe mocha before taking a swig.  The coffee place at the Walnut Mall in Shadyside is still my favorite for the iced coffee of the year award.  Try the iced OR blended ghiradelli mocha when you are shopping Shady-style - AWESOME!",neutral

It sure was difficult to eat as I had to dig into my food and look for something I recognize.  But I must say, there's a TON of food!  Good deal for a good price.

"The franchise owner reached out to me and gave me a store credit for my next visit. My fiance and I went today after work since he hasn't had it in a few months. We ordered to go again since we had errands to run after we ate. I explained to the store manager (a different one than I spoke to on the phone) and showed her the messages, let and she was very accommodating and polite. This time around they made sure to tell me that they cannot ensure fully gluten free as they don't have enough room to have a gluten free fryer. I am fine with that as long as they take precautions.  My fiance loved his meal and had 5 mild flats, while I had 5 honey bbq drumsticks. I ate the first one with no problem, but when I got to the second one I had a problem. I found a feather still attached to the wing. I called up the store to let her know and she was very apologetic. I actually had to laugh at my luck. I told her that I still didn't want free things and she told me that the cooks sort through the wings to try to catch those problems, but sometimes they slip through. I assured her it wasn't a problem and I just thought she should know. I ate every wing besides that one which seemed to pretty much fill me up.   While I can't give this location 100% yet due to the issues I've had back to back, I feel as though 3 stars is a whole lot better than 1.

Mellow mushrooms pizza is much bigger and more flavorful the same price. Beer was expensive 3 bucks for a budweiser. The service should have been more organized for such a small place. Someone mentioned that they didn't know what the place was supposed to be I've cream parlor or pizza bar and that is true it's very odd. Nice decor and quaint.

"The Penguin by name is a Charlotte classic. Unfortunately we didn't go earlier before the original place closed down, and only had the opportunity to go under the current ownership. While I can't compare it to how it used to be I can say that it is currently a decent burger joint. Not the best in the area, but still offers a solid burger experience.  The place looks like a real dive on the inside and out, but it's more about the food than the ambiance (at least in my book.) The menu is a bit confusing since the one on the website is not the one same as what they give you in the restaurant, so if you saw something you liked online you will have to figure out it's new name listed on the restaurant's menu. Not a huge deal, but the least they could do is keep the website updated. I was surprised to see that they offered Stewart's Root Beer...something I haven't had since leaving New York almost two years ago. We each got a bottle of that delicious soda ($1.95) and enjoyed sipping on it while awaiting the arrival of our burgers.  I ordered the Adelie burger ($7.95) and it was scrumptious. It's your basic ""Carolina"" or ""Southern"" burger in that it's topped with chili and cole slaw. The burger was a decent size and was delicious. The chili was a good chili and the slaw was crisp and tangy, bringing a variety of flavors to the overall burger. I had the sweet potato fries as a side and they were pretty dang good.  My wife ordered the King Penguin ($7.95), simply because she is a sucker for pimento cheese and fried pickles. She really enjoyed both on her burger. She tried to be a bit healthier and ordered the cole slaw as a side rather than some fries, but that didn't stop her from stealing a healthy portion of mine.  From a standalone point of view (not comparing it to the ""glory days"") the Penguin is a decent place to grab a burger. They are not the best burgers around but still a solid joint. The fact that the menu isn't up to date with what they actually offer and the cold, drafty interior definitely take some points away. I'd go back if I was in the area, but living in Huntersville it's a bit of a hike for us. And with Bad Daddy's serving up better burgers less than five minutes away I doubt we'll return.",neutral

"After talking to a couple locals who had raved about this place, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try since it was close to where we were staying. It is located on Queen West, across the street from McDonald's. We had taken public transportation to get here, but it didn't look like there were plenty of spaces to park.  Walking in, the restaurant was surprisingly small. As many have said, there is not much seating (less than 10 tables) and seemed very cramped together. You order and pay before finding a seat.  The Vatican ($11.59): 5/5. My boyfriend had chosen the Vatican.The cashier had stated that the burgers were made of the highest quality and only make the burgers to order. My boyfriend enjoyed it a lot, especially because of the fact that the buns are made out of grilled cheeses (Yes. You read that right.) The burger was packed full of ingredients and the patty was dense. He has a huge appetite and his burger really did the trick.  High Priest ($9.99): 3/5. I had chosen the High Priest. As someone who is from the West Coast of the United States, this reminded me a lot of an Animal Style burger from In 'n' Out. The patty was a bit on the drier side and lacked some seasoning, however the plethora of ingredients compensated for both problems. Though the burger was good, I could not seem to shake off the fact that they were so similar, yet this burger was almost double the price.  Though it was not the best burger I have ever had, I would definitely come again.",neutral

Beet Salad: 4/5 Goat cheese and beets were good, duck confit was dry. 2.) Seared Scallops: 3/5 Scallops were cooked correctly, however the broth they came in was completely flavorless 3,) Pasta w/short rib: 3.5/5 Pasta was cooked perfectly however the cream sauce was bland and there was barely and short rib. 4.) Filet: 2/5: Filet was cooked perfectly however there was a foam sauce all over it that was EXTREMELY SALTY and almost inedible.  5.) Dessert: 3/5: Dessert was a standard chocolate pie of some sort, it was ok. Seemed like it was just defrosted and not made in house.  Overall the food was OK, however for how expensive this place is, I can think of 20 other places in Cleveland I would rather go. I won't be returning here.",neutral

"Came here for lunch AYCE on a weekday.  Their menu doesn't have anything unique or special, pretty typical selection for AYCE sushi restaurant. Their nigiri were very fragile, with the rice part broke into two almost immediately after being picked up by chopstick. Their spicy salmon and salmon rose were much better and consistently made.  The service is very slow. I arrived before noon before lunch crowd came and it still took more than 70 mins in total. You'd better order everything in one order or else you have to be ready for extended lunch break. The waiters are generally friendly, but amount of sushi delivered were often less than what was ordered.  Overall, it's an okay AYCE sushi restaurant, one of many.",neutral

"MTL blog says that this is the one kebab place that you must check out in all of MontrΓ©al so my sister and I went there while we were in town. There is an upstairs and a downstairs and we got seated upstairs.   The host was super friendly but the server was a bit curt. Also, service was pretty slow. It took quite a while to get up to the table and get the drinks and everything else. The food itself was good. Not the best kebabs I have ever had but I lived in Germany and guess that I am more of a fan of Turkish/German/Belgian style than Iraqi style? We also got baba ghanouj (their spelling not mine) and it was good/ok. Maybe I should have gotten something else off the menu because it was all just good/ok. Finally we realized the server was not going to bring a bill (never mentioned it nor did he ever visit the table after dropping off the food) so we went downstairs and paid. Yes it was good but I would advise sitting downstairs and maybe not sticking to the basics as it seems there are many better things to eat than the kebabs.",neutral

"The dance floor isn't quite big enough for large parties. It's long and narrow so progressive dances become very problematic. It's more like a bowling ally than a dance floor! This only becomes a problem when medium sized crowds are there -- like 15 couples on the floor simultaneously.   Ambiant is a good place to take small group lessons or privates because in addition to the ballroom floor there are three smaller rooms for private lessons.   The sound system is substandard and gets worse as the size of the party grows.  The owner is a knowledgeable dance instructor and his staff are very capable. He is very enthusiastic about the studio and that counts for a lot when it comes to building a dance community.  The location is odd but once you know where it is, it's easy to find right off the 101.  The Scottsdale area should have a ballroom that can provide for 100+ dancers but Ambiant isn't it.",neutral

"Rating: 3 1/2* The half of star is based on the service.   We came for lunch on a Monday afternoon after spending the morning at the zoo. It was a cold morning so we felt like something comforting to eat and this place was close. This restaurant is located in a plaza full of Chinese businesses. It was fairly busy with only one waitress working the front of the restaurant.   We were promptly seated and we ordered right away since we were hungry. My wife went with the Kimchi chigae, I went with the Jjamppong while my daughter went with the Spicy Pork Lunch Bento box. We also ordered a Donkatsu too.   The food was okay. Nothing exceptional but nothing overly wrong either. The best dish was the Kimchi chigae with the Jjamppong being the most disappointing one. The Jjamppong was sweet instead of being spicy with somewhat generous offer of seafood. However, there was no shrimp. The spicy pork had the same problem. It was sweet instead of being spicy.   Service was adequate along with the prices.   I'm still in search of a great Jjamppong in the GTA...  #26 of 2018",neutral

"Sweet Basil served a mixture of Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese food.   The restaurant is nice and clean. The deco is simple but chic. The seatings is really comfortable.  However, I would not say this is authentic ethnic food. The spices are all toned down to suit the Canadian customers. We were there for lunch and we are the only oriental people there :).   Sweet Basil does have a good lunch menu ($5.99 - $7.99)! There are a lot of different choices. Even my vegetarian friend found something she enjoyed!  In light of the spirit of Pho-bruary I still stick to my Pho lunch. I ordered the Beef Pho in spicy tomato soup with vegetarian spring roll ($5.99) and my friend ordered the Thai Mango vegetarian combo with spring rolls/vegetarian hot and sour soup ($7.99).  The spring rolls are fresh and quite tasty. Ok I ate all 3 spring rolls because my friend does not like anything deep fried. So they must be quite tasty for me to eat them all :).  The hot and sour soup does have a lot of ingredients inside. However it is not Hot (not spicy hot or pipping hot). It is pretty thick in consistency but it is luke warm. I think it is lurk warm that's why it is thick.  I did request extra extra spicy for my Pho. However the broth comes out lukewarm. That does create a problem since the beef are served rare so they cannot be cooked proper in the warm broth. The broth is not hot (spicy or pipping). There are tons of fresh tomatoes inside and chives. The noodles is the dried type but it tasted ok. However, I would not order this again when I come back for another visit.  My friend's Thai Mango stir fried has pepper, mango, mushroom, carrots, baby corn, onion, dried tofu and water chestnut. She finished the whole thing! She said it tasted really good........  I am so glad that she enjoys her meal because sometimes it is so hard to din with vegetarian friend.  They accepts Mastercard.  I would come back to try out other lunch specials but it would not be eating Pho. And I would have to tell them XXXXXX spicy!",neutral

I chose ranch for my dressing for my salad, (not that great or fresh!)  I got the order to go, (as I live in Boulder City) as there are no healthy options in town. When I got home I was a little disappointed in the meal. For one, the greens are not really fresh and some were brown on the edges and others were just soggy and rotting.

"I was at Cava once before and had a very memorable meal. This time around, I was quite disappointed. Overall the meal here was not a bad one. But it wasn't very good either. We didn't get a good value for our money, and the only flavour for the food was salt, salt and more salt. Cava is said to be one of the better tapas restaurants in town, and over the years it has received good reviews. It may be that they are resting on their laurels. But, they better start picking up their game if they want to maintain their clientele base.  ""SUPERGILDA""  - Price: $5 - Rating: 2/5 - The dish came highly recommended by the waitress, only to disappoint. - Consists of a single crouton covered with a small slice of sardine, but ruined with the addition of a toothpick skewering a couple of olives and an anchovy. It was a very 1980's presentation and the flavour was salt on top of salt on top of more salt.  CROQUETA OF JAMΓ“N WITH CAPER-SULTANA SAUCE - Price: $4 - Rating: 1/5 - Thumb-sized croquet tasted OK, but was very little value for your hard-earned money.  CHICKEN LIVER & FOIE GRAS MOUSSE WITH TOASTED HOUSE-MADE BREAD AND ACCOMPANIIMENTS - Price: $13 - Rating: 4/5 - Very tasty, silky smooth mousse. - Not a very large portion.  JAMON SERRANO - Price: $17 - Rating: 4/5 - Nice ham, descent portion  PAPAS FRITAS  - Price: $7.50 - Rating: 5/5 - Amazing fries!  These fries alone salvaged the meal!  EGGPLANT WITH QUESO FRESCO, BONITO, & TOMATILLO SAUCE - Price: $12 - Rating: 3/5 - Nice dish, the bonito flakes add a nice accent.  PAELLA - Price: $65 - Rating: 2/5 - The chicken was nice, but not plentiful (only 2 quarter legs) - The clams were dry - The shrimp was nice - There was very little rice and it was  VERY salty, almost un-edible. - Overall, a salty unsatisfying EXPENSIVE dish.  TAJINE OF LAMB WITH QUINOA, AND ROASTED OKRA - Price: $23 - Rating: 1/5 - There were only small traces of lamb meat, which was dry and salty - The okra was extra slimy - no effort to reduce the slime - The dish was not presented in a tajine, which is kind of the main point.  I ordered a Tempranillo which they ran out of. They highly recommended an alternative at a higher price. But it turns out it was a blend with only 1/3 Tempranillo and wasn't very good.  The service was overall good.",neutral
"I have received delivery from this restaraunt three times.  The first two times went well and the food was very good...even once when they ran out of ribs and phoned me to ask if they could substitute broasted chicken for a half slab of ribs, the customer service was great and the chicken was really good.  However, the third time I ordered food from this location did not go so well.  I ordered an 8 piece chicken combo meal.  The menu advertises this meal as two of each piece of chicken (breast, thigh, leg and wing) and two sides, but that is not what I received.  I received 4 thighs, 3 legs, and 1 wing...yes that adds up to eight pieces of chicken but not as advertised on the menu and included no breasts.  Also, I ordered the macaroni salad as one of the sides...mind you this is for an eight piece combo dinner...I received one 3.25 oz container of macaroni salad, which is the size of one container of salad dressing.  The menu also states that the combo dinners are served with garlic bread, which was not included in the delivery.  I will reiterate the food is good thus the three star rating, but the attention to detail was not adequate.  I will order from this restaraunt again because the food is good....if the order comes as advertised on the menu, I will chalk this last experience up as a fluke and will improve my overall rating for this restaraunt.",neutral

"I've had Belleria a few times during the summer and early fall and was thoroughly impressed with their NY style pizza. I have dined on location and also taken pizzas to go.  The servers are quick and friendly- no problems there. And, the pizza is pretty good. However, the last couple times have been less than satisfactory and all due to breakdowns in communication. The first issue was that sauce was left off of a NY style mushroom pizza that I added spinach to. Even then, it wasn't too shabby. The second, and most recent, incident included a few missteps. First was that banana peppers were put on the pizza instead of jalapeΓ±os, which I asked for. Second, I asked that there were no onions on my antipasto salad. Third, I found a piece of sausage on my mushroom and ""pepper"" pizza. Lastly, after taking a glance at the pizza at the counter I told the hostess that there were banana peppers on the pizza when the ticket so clearly said jalapeΓ±os. She literally said nothing to any effect of wanting to help and I ended up paying $25 for a pizza I didn't want and a salad that was laden with undesired onions.   Now, am I too good to eat some banana peppers? No. Was I gonna make a big deal about it and ask them to make it again? No. But, what I do expect is some type of accountability for that type of mistake. Maybe hook a sister up with a free 2 liter or take my name down and discount my next order.   Obviously, my issues at Belleria don't include the quality of the food or waitstaff but simply the lackluster attitude of the hostess, and thereby the business, for not emphasizing the value of their repeat customers by owning up to and fixing mistakes.",neutral

"I was fortunate enough where my friends lined up on our behalf and got us some cakes so that took away the frustrations of waiting in line to get a piece of cake!   In terms of packaging, the cake as seen in numerous (or many to be accurate) Facebook posts everywhere on the internet, they are nicely packaged and the uncle tetsu stamp on top is very adorable.   In terms of flavour, I dont think it's worth the wait. It taste like those $1 sponge cakes that you can get from the Chinese supermarket (a bit more fluffier) with some cream cheese flavour infused into it. It's very light, not too rich, as expected from Japanese desserts. I would buy it again and again if it's on the way and without lineup.

The options are endless and all get served with nice fluffy eggs and those scrumptious fried potatoes!   The service- Is always top notch. Drinks are always refilled and you never have to wait 30 minutes for a check.   The not-so-good:  Eggs Benedict- I once ordered this entree and the piece of ham had a huge piece of cartilage in it. It spanned across half of the piece of ham. It was so unappetizing that it took me almost 6 months to return here to eat.   The long wait time- If you are unfortunate enough to get here after 9am on a weekend or on a holiday, be prepared to wait. I have waited in excess of 30 minutes for a table of 2.

"My fiancee and I went there in December 2013 for dinner. We ordered some cocktails, a bottle of wine, 3 appetizers and 2 mains. Everything was delicious EXCEPT our main of scallops. Disgusting.

The size of the portions was absolutely enormous. I had the roumanian steak and it was cooked correctly and tasted pretty good (it could have used a little more salt).   I really liked the homemade greek vinaigrette dressing, but the salad itself was kind of sad, limp, and randomly had uncooked cauliflower on it.   I would definitely want to return and try their breakfasts, but I am not sure that I would order dinner again as it was just ok.   The service was pretty good.

They cook with a gas oven which makes for a consistent cook. The sauce is delicious and the pepperoni is perfectly sliced.The crust is just like home too! (I'm from the east coast)  I would have given this place five stars, but the staff was a little rude, which honestly, is fine with me because thats what I'm used to from an east coast pizza shop.   If you live in Southwest Vegas, don't go anywhere else but Familia. It's a small shop tucked behind Bohas restaurant. You can dine in or take out.

"I was introduced to this restaurant from a new friend - I know of this great secret Mexican restaurant hole in the wall youre going to love.  So after all that anticipation and making it there, I can tell you she was correct.  This is a great Mexican eatery that I would like!  Unfortunately not yet, I did not enjoy the juice bar.  When I ate there, I was unreasonably hungry that I ordered the most gigantic Torta I have ever seen.  The Del Rey.  Holy heart attack on a plate batman!  I imagine even weeks separated from that meal, that I am still suffering from that explosion of food that I consumed.  And it was so unbelievably delicious that I cannot imagine that I would like to find any justification to repeat that transgression again  So why the 3/5 mark.  I think a lot of the food is greasy.  I would really prefer more heart healthy food to give a rating of great / excellent.  But perhaps very authentic to Mexico.  And I also love that the food is a SUPER value.  That is HUGE.  I hated that I was served potato chips with the meal, but perhaps that is standard with a Torta?  And I wanted so bad to ask the waitress to turn the channel to NFL football - but I did have enough sense that I was in a Mexican place, surrounded by Mexican families, that probably like watching their version of football.",neutral

"Took the wife here for breakfast on Mother's Day. It was early enough that the wait was only 15 minutes or so. Took a while, about 10 minutes to place our order with the server. She did greet us and let us know she would be with us shortly as the family next to us had sat down first. I know that Mothers Day is the busiest day of the year for restaurants so I was patient and understanding.   The menu had a good variety of options and was laid out and visually appealing. The ambience of the restaurant was very quaint, classy and comfortable. The server was friendly and took our order right away since we were ready by then and didn't want to take a chance on the next go around. They were obviously under staffed.   The food presentation was excellent, but the food quality and flavor is why I gave them 3 stars. The steak was chewy and tough, the scrambled eggs were not fluffy, hash browns undercooked etc. I really wanted to love this place, but the food was the crescendo that fell flat.   I will give them another try for sure as they are very close to home. I also understand today of all days could have been an anomaly due to high volume business.   Overall, I would recommend going there, but don't get your hopes to high!",neutral

"I remember when I was younger and saw the Luxor for the first time. I wanted to stay there! When visiting Vegas recently, I decided to fork out the cash to satisfy my inner child. I don't regret staying in the Luxor - it was clean and quiet - but it wasn't what I was expecting. It's just a middle class hotel, really, and if that's what you want and the Luxor is offering a good rate, then go for it. Just make sure to learn about the resort fee before you make your reservation.  As for my experience, the Luxor was clean but the shower drain was clogged, causing an overflow onto the bathroom floor. Our room had a view of the strip, although being on the south end of the strip, the view wasn't impressive at all. The sloped window was impressive for all of two seconds. Check-in was a breeze. Finally, I'll mention that the salespeople working the hotel floor were a little annoying.",neutral

"In protest of the lousy service that I've experienced at the Go For Tea in Scarborough, I decided to drive a bit further to their Richmond Hill location.  I do not mind driving the distance if it means that I'm less irritated on my way home about the horrible food experience.  This location is much bigger, although parking is not as plentiful as the Scarborough counterpart and you have to compete with patrons who share the lot with a plaza that is also home to a Baton Rouge.    I ended up scoring a sweet parking spot that I am surprised was not reserved as a Handicap spot because of its proximity to the front entrance, but I shall shut up and count my blessings!  We were promptly seated.  It appears that the employees hired at this location have a working knowledge on their English.  About 2 minutes after we were seated, our server came by to take our order.  I ordered a Honey Green Tea to nurse my undying cough, and Boyfriend ordered the Coffee Milk Tea.    We lingered for about another hour longer after we finished our respective drinks, and I was surprised when a server brought us glasses of water.    For once, I can say that I have found a bubble tea establishment that has quality service worth mentioning.    They also do not set a password on their wi-fi which means that you can start surfing the moment you walk in the door.  The Scarborough location requires a password... I could crack a Scarborough joke, but I really don't think I need to add to the list of ever-growing Scarborough jokes that already exist.",neutral
"The food is what keeps me coming back - I've been here over 6 times now and every time, I pray the service is better. It never is. Sometimes I have had a reservation and other times not. Never seems to matter because they always want to kick you out after an hour and a half. Which is strange seeing that every time I have been there, there have been ample seating space. The hostess is so rude, it's almost comical. She isn't very smart, she's put off by the simplest questions. The waiters are just as bad. The service is lethargic and the pretentious but the food is great. You'd think whoever owns / manages this place would clue into to getting top of the line service. I could care less what the service's attire is as long as they are friendly and don't roll their eyes when you ask a simple question -- for example -- an extra friend was joinging us and we had a reservation for 4 - easy to put a chair at the end of our table. Hostess rolled her eyes. I couldn't believe it. You spend $250 on the bill -- you spend that kind of money not to be treated so horribly.",neutral

"My wife ended up getting a ""free"" stay at this resort because she booked a trip to NY last year at a Holiday Inn that was next to the reception venue we were going to be at.  I guess they do this to try and sell their time shares.  So we reluctantly booked it as we go to Vegas often so why not get a free stay?  Unfortunately you have to sit through their sales presentation but we already knew we were going to say no so no biggie.  The resort itself isn't bad.  The first one we had reeked like cigarette smoke so we asked to be moved.  The living room actually has a gas burning fireplace.  Who the hell needs a fireplace in hot-ass Vegas?!?!  The rooms are a decent size and have a full kitchen which is nice since you can buy your own food and cook to save a bit of money.  But we mainly go to Vegas for the food scene so doing our own cooking isn't high on our list.  The bedroom was pretty small.  In fact there's only about 2 feet of space between the edge of the bed and the wall and with the TV mounted on that wall I had to walk sideways to be able to get around the bed.  The bedroom has a nicely organized closet but unfortunately the one we had, had no light in it so it was hard to find your belongings once you had put them in there.  There is a restaurant on the property and a little market downstairs that has most things you could need but the prices are outrageous.  Then again it's Vegas and everything's expensive.  When you do the time share presentation they take you to one of the model rooms which are actually much nicer and a little bigger than the ones you get on a normal stay.  I thought this was a little weird.  If you're trying to get me to buy a time share I would assume you'd want to impress me right off the bat.  We spent about 2 hours total on the presentation even though we told the sales guy right off the bat that we weren't buying.  But they didn't pressure us too much.  They just gave us the normal speil about how you spend so much money every year going on vacations and time shares save you money and you can go to all these different places and blah, blah, blah.  The resort has 5 pools but they're all pretty small and funky shaped so they're not good for trying to do laps or get any exercise in.  The complex has 2 exercise rooms but the one I looked at was a joke.  All it had was one lat pulldown machine, a chest press machine, a leg extension machine and a couple of treadmills.  No way to get a quick full body workout like I was wanting.  The resort is directly behind the Linq about a block away from the strip, but Vegas blocks are HUGE.  The shuttle times aren't super convenient so quite a few times we just walked up to Harrah's and would catch the monorail from there to go up and down the strip.  The shuttles run pretty much every other hour.  Having the shuttle run every hour would be much more convenient.  The main lobby has this weird smell.  I don't know if it's supposed to be some sort of flower but I don't want to smell any flower that smells like that.  Overall this resort is just OK.  It's not terrible but I wouldn't stay there again.",neutral

"I really wanted to love you, L'Etoile, but the service and food was just ok.  We did the tasting menu with wine pairings.  It started with a basket of cold bread (at these prices, some warm fresh bread should be part of the deal).  Speaking of bread, the table next to us waited so long for their bread that they had to ask for some, to which the server replied ""we try to time these things accordingly.""  Dude, the people are hungry!  Just give them the bread.  We also got served someone else's tea course before our food came out, much to our confusion, and no one acknowledged the gaff, so we just sipped it like like, ""thanks for the chamomile...?""  Less then stellar culinary moments included a protein and melon dish with such large chunks of melon that it overpowered the whole thing (I can't even recall what the protein was - fish?  Foie gras? Therein lies the problem, it just wasn't memorable).  We eagerly anticipated the steak course which was served somewhat blandly with potatoes, swimming in corn gravy (it was begging for some acidity or brightness) and the meat was cooked just a little too long for that nice of a cut. Highlights were the dessert (a scrumptious custard) and the wonderful and quirky sommelier, Steven.  He was a breath of fresh air and we loved everything that was paired with the meal.  That being said, I wouldn't go back the next time we're in Madison.",neutral

Their topping options are limited and the hot sauce is the best part. Perfectly salty and spicy. I would come here again if I was in a rush and looking for a quick meal. Nothing special though.,neutral

"Took my hunny here for his birthday today.....welll.............  So I had reservations at 6:15pm....the restaurant is somewhat hidden beneath a huge apartment structure so we drove around twice to find the parking structure...which had no visual signs. After parking we were trying to find an exit from the parking structure and when we finally surfaced the creepy underground parking lot, we had to go through a maze in the Arizona heat around the apartments for about 5 minutes before reaching the restaurant at the opposite end of the parking structure. I was in a black dress and heels and boy was I sweating. Once I got in there I light-heartedly said to the host ""Omg why is it so hard to find this place...I've been walking in a maze! Then he laughing said well it's good that you're here now and we'll quickly get you some ice water to cool u down and sat us down at a nice table.   So this was our first time here but I already kinda know how it works since I've been to other restaurants with tasting menus...but for this one they give you this orange sheet with the price listing for the number of courses you want and any thing you don't like you can cross out or write down. There is a minimum of 4 course for $50, 5 for $60, 6 for $70 and 7 for $80 and then there's the full tasting for $140 and a supplement of $15 if you want one of dish to be Foie Gras.   So my bf and I decided on 7 course and supplement a dish for foie gras. I don't  like alcohol but they had an option on their drink menu for non-alcoholic cocktails...so basically they would mix any cocktails without the alcohol so I thought that was pretty cool.  I started with a salad and my bf started with a soup..then the other dishes came out in between 15-20 minute intervals. I did not like the way they made the foie gras...because it had a sugar caramelized coat and was a bit too burnt..which to me ruin the foie gras. So I DO NOT recommend the $15 foie gras supplement. I also did not like the creme brulee dessert...it was too wet and I was not fond of the taste either. Other then that the other dishes was okay...it wasn't really mind-blowing.   The service wasn't spectacular....for the price I paid I expect beyond great service but eh our waiter was okay...he came with our dishes, explained it and then walked away...came back after we were done, took our plates and walked away again...it was a slow night too....there were only about 5 other couples there..and we each had our own servers so I think they could have done a better job.  The bill came out to be around $273....my bf didn't even have wine..just two Blue Moon beers. Overall I'm not too thrill about this place...it's only been opened for like 2 years and 8 months. I didn't mind spending the money but I do expect to get what I paid for...in this case I do not feel I have...sooo would I come here again? mmmmm maybe not.    FYI: Yelp says it's dressy and Opentable.com says it's causal elegant....Honestly it doesn't freakin really matter...my bf and I dressed up really nice...only to find that some other people were in regular polo shirts, jeans, shorts and filp-flops!! this really irritates me....at least try not to wear flip-flops at such an expensive restaurant! -_-"" And I find this the case in many of the fine dining restaurants I've been to..-_-""""""""",neutral
"Because of it's close proximity to my house, I decided to give it another try (with Groupon pricing.)  Went in shortly after they opened so I didn't have to wait long at all.  After having been to some other car washes, I've learned not to have high expectations.  My car was basically clean although the drivers side mirror and window were obviously neglected and left spotty.  Just don't expect excellent service.  Definitely wouldn't pay full price but with discount pricing it's okay.",neutral

"We went this evening. Have been there so so many times, as they have a great Happy Hour! This evening, we asked for a table for 6, outside. We were told 15-20 minutes. After an hour, sitting around the fire place, seeing 6 tables (4 seat tables) open, I had to go back to the hostess and inquire. He said, no tables were available for 6, as he was sitting a table for 4. I asked why he could not put 2 tables together. He then agreed. We finally had a table, but no server.

Taste has an omelet bar which also doubles as a breakfast sandwich station and they also offer an omelet of the day or you can create your own. They get brownie points in my book for offering egg white omelets and have a nice selection of add ins. Omelet was good but didn't seem to gel too well together so I think I will stick to making my own at home. While waiting for my omelet, I looked at the prices of their sandwiches and it seemed a little more than I would like to spend for lunch so think this will be a breakfast only place for me when I want a sandwich. Unfortunately since it was right before the holiday and breakfast time, I didn't get the entire Taste experience.  The cashier seemed too involved with her conversation with a random and just sucked her teeth when she told me the price so that turned me off a bit.

For dinner entrees you can get more for your money elsewhere.  But it's not all bad.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service was excellent.  I had a good time and I'd happily go back for appetizers (most are $8-10).  Pino's is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring 40-50 year old women.

Unfortunately I hadn't gone in a while and when I recently went I honestly thought I went through the wrong door.  They apparently added on and turned the new section into a fancy trendy feel.  I was so disappointed.  They took a masterpiece, and just in my opinion, ruined it.  It now has the same look and feel as all new modern steakhouses.  It would be better for for NYC than Pittsburgh.  I really am distraught how they could just do a 180 turn to the look and feel.  No longer cozy.  No more charm.  I hope they are doing well and I'm sure they are, but this place is no longer for me.

I thought this was very rude since we were only there a little over an hour and paid $80! In Europe and many U.S. Restaurants, this would be frowned upon. We were also never asked if we wanted more coffee (that we poured ourselves). The server asked us once how our food was 1 minute after the meals were dropped, not even enough time to pick up my fork and take a bite. Even though the food was great, that's not the only thing that needs focus in a restaurant. Probably won't return because there are plenty of restaurants in PGH that have good food AND GOOD SERVICE.

"I know Moe's probably doesn't want to be considered ""fast"" food, but did I really have to wait 15 minutes in line today just to get my lunch?  And, lest you think it was crowded, let me assure you that it wasn't.  There were 3 of us in line...and 3 people behind the counter.  And it took me 15 minutes from start to finish.  Thanks for eating up my lunchtime, Moe's!    I've been to this Moe's before, but today was definitely the most inefficient of my visits.  It was as if Tuesday was ""New Hires"" Day -- yea!  Watching the person try to roll up my burrito was excruciatingly  painful.  Then I did the unthinkable.  I asked to use a coupon for a free bowl of hot queso that Moe's had sent me for signing up for their email club.  GASP!  I did not want the lunch combo that includes a small side of queso.  I wanted the free bowl with coupon (for which they charge a whopping $3.50 normally!) on the side so I could share it with my co-worker.  And, no, I didn't want to just get the combo and save the coupon to use it another time.  It expires in two weeks, and do you think I want to come back before then after this experience?  Again, I was quite sure I didn't want the combo that I have to pay extra for and includes a small container of queso in addition to the large cup that was entitled to get for free.  I realized it would make it SO much easier for the fresh-out-of-cashier-school cashier to ring me up, but I really just want the one burrito and one side of queso, and I wanted to use the coupon that was sent to me as a ""valuable"" member of the Moe's email club.  No, I didn't want a soft drink, just water, please.  The cashier wasn't quite sure how to ring it up, so we went round and round, and the cashier had to pull in the burrito wrapper for help.  15 minutes after I stepped into line, I was out of there, on my way to my table, and miraculously only paid for one burrito.  God bless Moe's.  The meal was good overall (thankfully my burrito was wrapped in foil to keep it warm), but I'm still more of a Qdoba fan.  Besides being more efficient, their burritos have better flavor.  The good thing about Moe's, though, is that they give you free chips and have a salsa bar where I can dive into my favorite tomatillo salsa.  And the queso was good, if not a little runny.  But certainly not worth $3.50.",neutral

"Good location in the Safeway center on 32nd and Camelback with easy parking. Interior sacrifices comfort for trend--metal seats, small tables close together.

"Really a 3.5.  We did brunch/breakfast on a Saturday, and the menu is certainly well conceived, and stretches beyond the normal eggs, bacon, and hash. There are some great combos (brussel sprouts and lima bean hash), and some great egg combos with great cheese options beyond the norm. Service is good, execution of the dishes is good enough, but the rating would be better if they pulled off a few of the option with a bit more quality - it is busy on the weekend AMs - but I would recommend it to anyone. Pretty good stuff.",neutral

"This is what its name says: it's a hole in a rock. And that's really it.   We went on a Monday morning and even then there were a lot of people there taking pictures. This attraction is right next to the Phoenix Zoo so you will see a lot of people from that. The space itself is really small so it's tough to get a nice picture without other people in it. If you want to avoid those people, go early because if all you want is a nice picture, it shouldn't take long.  It's about a 5 minute walk from where we parked. Where we parked, it's not a big parking lot but there's a ton of parking a little further out where the zoo parking is. I wouldn't even consider it a hike.  In terms of a view, it's not the best view because from where we were looking out, you're just looking at a parking lot. There are many other tourist attractions in the area that have a much nicer view.  There's really not much else and I'd say if you're in the area, stop by just to say you've been, but don't go out of your way to go here.",neutral

"I ended up stumbling on this place the other day during lunch. We went to go to the Thai place that was there, but apparently they moved across the street. At the time I didn't know that. We did see this place, and decided to go into avoid wandering around looking for a place for lunch.   The only complaint I have, is that when we walked in it was very dark, and no customers were in there, and the gentleman working was not very inviting. To clarify: He wasn't mean or anything, we just couldn't even tell if the place was open or not, and being actively warm, friendly, and inviting would be recommended, as it was confusing to determine whether this empty restaurant was under construction or what was going on in there. I am not a very friendly guy, so I don't like doing the duty of breaking the ice, however I had to do it in this case.  After we figured out the place was open for business, we sat down to eat. We looked at the menu, and the it seemed like you got a lot for the lunch specials for the price. I ordered the butter chicken hot, and my coworker ordered the lamb vindaloo. The gentleman working there made it seem like going hot would be a dangerous choice, but I said OK I'll live with it.  The lunch specials were $10, and after we picked and ordered, it didn't seem like it took that long to come out. Well maybe now that I'm thinking about it, it did considering there was no one in the restaurant other than us. So the food came out and I was very happy with the portions and the assortment that was on the plate.  There was what I believe to be a samosa, one of those little cheese dessert balls soaked in syrup, a generous portion of butter chicken, jasmine rice, I believe there was a Tamrind sauce, and a mint chutney I think.  The butter chicken was delicious, however, if you're with company that wants a really hot spicy food, the hot they gave me was not that hot at all. That being said I'm glad because it tasted good, but I could see somebody being disappointed that really enjoys hot food.  another great thing about this place is they gave us a very generous helping of garlic naan. I loved it and unlike another review, there was no sand or whatever in mine. It was top notch Naan.  There was not too much service to be had, but there was not too much service that was needed. The food was good, the pricing seemed reasonable, and I was happy. I would recommend this place.  The ambience (empty, dim, old furniture and decoration style) leaves a little bit to be desired, but maybe they'll become busier and it will seem nicer with people there. The only way I would take a chick on a dinner date here is if I wanted to find out if she was high maintenance or not. If your chick is chill, or you just want to do casual lunch or are you going to do take out this is definitely a great place to go.",neutral

"Reason for Visit: Craving some fish noodle soup with some friends  Menu: I've been here for a few years now, and only thing that has been increasing is their price ($11.50 now per bowl). It is still in my opinion reasonable as they do give a lot of toppings, more than most other noodle joints like Dagu. I personally go for their parsley soup or black pepper as their original fish soup is a bit bland.  (note: if you want a cold drink it is an extra $1)  Service: You check off what you want then give to a waitress. Fast and efficient. No concerns.  Atmosphere: Average decorated. Lighting is a bit dim.   Overall: 3/5. It is what you pay for, not the best noodles out there, but you get what you paid for. This place is great if you want a quick decent meal.",neutral

Not perfect, so just staring at the waiter eye to eye is not enough to get their attention, but hey, this is Canada, service is bad here on average.  The steaks and potatoes au gratin had no taste to them. Really bland. My aunt is a chef, and I can 100% testify that Jacobs' potatoes au gratin blows, I had way better at home every time.  Duck fat fries tasted bad too.    Considering that steaks are their specialty, and even a $10 steak from Quinn's steakhouse tastes better... well, I will not be back.   Disclaimer: This is my personal experience, my buddies liked their steaks more than I did. :) We were unanimous on the potatoes/fries though.",neutral

The show was average. The other reviews on site were on point. It was kinda cheesy and seemed to be pointed at kids or  family. The dancers were good but I wanted more.

"I had a pretty debilitating bout of stomach flu last week, and this was the first day I could finally eat something other than applesauce, chicken noodle soup, and congee. I figured why not celebrate by trying out this new eatery?  I got here on opening day maybe an hour after they officially opened. It looked like half the Asian population in the Phoenix area was eating here lol. The menu is pretty succinct but all the items on it looked delicious. There was a really long lag in ordering since there seemed to be a little confusion with some existing orders. When it was my turn to order I went with the #5 jajangmyeon. I actually wanted to get it to go but apparently they don't offer that here (Boo). Although I had to wait a long time to actually order the jajangmyeon was made in a few short minutes. It looked so tempting and was a big portion. We grabbed some chopsticks, etc. from the side counter (It also had forks, napkins, and condiments). I took it to one of the tables in the food court area and started digging in!  The noodles were plentiful and cooked a touch beyond ""al dente"". The sauce was smooth but the flavor wasn't as bold as other jajangmyeon I've had in the past. It was too oily for my tastes and I would have liked more cucumber(?) than the small tiny mound on top. I was also disappointed to find that 90% of the sauce had only onion and cabbage in it, with some small scraps of meat.  I didn't see any options for beverages here (Other than a water cooler in the corner) which I thought was odd but I suppose you could just buy a beverage from Tous Les Jours next door.  Although I didn't totally enjoy the jajangmyeon, some other items on the menu looked really enticing, especially the tangsuyuk so I will be back to try more!",neutral

"It was a meal of highs and lows.  This casual sit-down eatery had no shortage of Chicago memorabilia or senior citizen patrons.  It's like they're going head-to-head against NY54 Pizza over in Sun Lakes.  The mussels in red sauce were a FANTASTIC appetizer.  The spicy, garlicky (sp?)sauce was a great complement to the perfectly cooked mussels.  I wish I got the full pound instead of the half.  I also wish they served bread or even another bowl for the shells.  My wife's pasta fagioli was not nearly as appetizing.  It tasted like Campbell's tomato soup with a few noodles and cannellini beans thrown in.The house salad was standard, but at least it was fresh and crisp.  The vinagrette was a little tart for my taste.  We split a pizza.  The subtle notes of the crispy thin crust and tangy tomato sauce were solid, but they were totally overwhelmed by a thick layer of bland cheese.  Toppings were sparse.  The homemade tiramisu was good, but not great.  It was a little too whip creamy, and am I the only one who doesn't like chocolate sauce over tiramisu?  I want to savor the coffee flavor, not the Hershey's syrup.  In summary, I'd go back.  Anything in their tomato sauce is bound to be good, especially the spicy version.  Try the mussels.  Pass on the pizza and the pasta fagiole.",neutral

"No noodles in their Chow Mein dish. Not a single one.  I ordered lunch for myself and 6 other employees through Bitesquad for a lunch meeting. Two of the seven members ordered chow mein, and neither person received any noodles at all. One order was spicy beef chow mein, and the other was a vegetable chow mein. One bowl was literally just vegetables, and the other was beef in a bowl full of vegetables. The member who received the bowl full of vegetables went and bought lunch elsewhere. The only reason we even ordered from Autumn Court is because she was craving noodles and we saw that Autumn Court had a very large selection of noodle dishes.    I give three stars because the members whose orders were not incorrect said it was very delicious, and I believe that this could have been a one time accident. The crab puffs were crispy and seasoned well, and the potstickers were large and meaty. The member who ordered the Dan Dan noodles said they were very flavorful and had nice texture, and even the noodle-less Spicy Beef Chow Mein dish tasted good, although it would be more in line with a spicy beef and vegetable dish. Also, the order was made perfectly on time.  I would NOT recommend this restaurant for takeout, but I suppose if you eat at the actual restaurant you can ensure mistakes like missing noodles in a Chow Mein dish do not occur.",neutral
"I went with a group on a Monday night at 7 pm. The place was pretty busy considering it was a weekday. The staffs were friendly and filled our glasses with water quite often but there was no ice in the water... I started with the cold seafood section and had the shrimp, muscles and baby octopus. The shrimp's texture was off and the smell wasn't quite right. It tasted ok with the overly thick seafood sauce so I ate it anyway. The muscles were good. I tried the baby octopus but i think it was raw so it wasn't edible after the first one. I then went on to the hot section. They had a good selection but a lot of the meat looked old or like it was sitting under the heat lamp all day or maybe even leftovers from another day... The food from the grill was really good and seemed fresh. The fruits (strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, watermelon, grapes, pineapple) were all perfectly ripe and the desserts were delicious!",neutral

I told her I just needed my membership redone. She said, ""yeah well I can't do this. I can't wave your fee. Only a manager can set all this up."" I was pretty frustrated at this point and told her that it was my 3rd trip there. Quickly she changed it up on me, ""well, I'll do it but I need your account and routing numbers"". I'm sorry, but are you kidding? I called her out on her lie and walked out.

"So many people said this place was no good or too pricey. I don't think it's cheap, but I think I got fair food for the price compared to other Ramen places. It's only fair to compare all these ramen places against each other given they are all starting around same time. I went to another one earlier this week.  At Momofuku, the portion was definitely bigger than the other two I recently went to. The Momofuku ramen also had two meats in there, the pork belly and some pulled pork. That's something that the other two did not have. So given these two things, putting a larger price isn't so bad.  The one feature of this ramen is really the egg. I was amazed how this poached eggs withstood pressure from my chopstick. I didn't try to puncture, but I was really trying to see what made it move around so easily as not to break. I don't know what it is. But what I like about eggs usually in ramen is i eat a bit of it, eat some noodles, then come back to it. But this one, since it was poached, I had to eat it immediately.  I don't think the broth is bad, but it definitely wasn't as good as some others.  I went on a Friday night, and didn't really have to wait. I guess the place is bigger with more seats, so didn't have the same wait anymore.  I also had this rice pudding with apple and black sesame cookie. The cookie was nice, the apple was nice in the pudding, but I like the pudding to be a bit my milky. The consistency was a bit odd in my opinion, kinda soft but not too soft.  I'd say this is like America's version of Ramen, bigger and more salt.",neutral

"Not a big fan of breakfast food, BUT everything I ate here was actually VERY good! I had strawberry pancakes, sausage patties and a bowl of grits.  However, I will be hesitant to return because of a few things:  a) The place is small and the wait can be quite long. We went on a random Thursday around 11 am and, despite it not being very crowded, we waited 20 minutes for a table...  b) Service....was pretty bad. After waiting, we were not greeted by our server for another 10 minutes...  c) Cleanliness: Our table when we were seated had not been properly washed. I also witnessed loys of crumbs/mess on the floor beneath other tables. They appeared to be using a bissel to try to keep up with the mess, but it was not pleasant to see as a diner.  d)Long Wait for Food AFTER Ordering   Use this information as you will!",neutral
"Posto Panino seems to be a new place with a good amount of seating and a quick service takeout or dine in menu. The menu is basically Italian with a range of pizzas, sandwiches and pasta dishes.   The prices for the sandwiches seem reasonable until you start adding some toppings. Just a few extra additions can double the cost of the sandwich. An $8.00 veal sandwich comes out to $12 with cheese and mushrooms.   The taste was good and the environment is OK. What seems to be lacking is a bit of enthusiasm on the people who work there. They seem to be a bit ""unmotivated"". It's hard to describe, just one of those feelings.   Overall I think that Posto Panino will become a good quick casual spot in King City. I will definitely return when I'm the area to try some other dishes.",neutral

"I came here during soft opening and was happy about the 10% off and free ice cream. The place definitely is very downtown restaurant brunch vibes given the decor. I love the gold, white and blue theme. However, I waited 45+ minutes to be seated and honestly, I feel like the way they've made the seating isn't using the space very well. We tried the slow cooked short rib donburi. I thought it was good combination of flavours but honestly, $19 is not worth it. The cold brewed teas were presented very nicely in the glass bottle and there was a variety of options. I tried the lychee calpis soda drink and thought that was pretty good too. Service on the other hand was just okay and not sure why but the waitresses seemed a bit confused when taking orders. As for the free ice-cream, it was delicious and my favourite part of my visit as it was a nice milk tea flavour which I love! Nonetheless, I don't think I will be coming here again since it was pricey and just a one time experience for me.",neutral

"I re-located from Texas to Nevada. I applied for several apartments, but I chose Cheyenne Villas. I had not heard any negative reviews regarding this property. I have been here since February 2017.

I find that LaShelle, Linda and Lee are very kind and understanding and they attempt to handle any issues that arise. I recently moved to a larger unit and on this side of the property, there are a LOT of children. My original apartment was very quiet. The children tend bother things, dump trash on the ground instead of in the trash containers, flip the major breaker switch (my switch does not have a cover) so that I have no electricity, but kids are kids. And the maintenance staff really do a great job keeping the property neat and clean. I really feel that the staff here are Cheyenne Villas are very good. I have no intention of moving out soon.

"I have to preface this by saying I love Starbucks! Love their drinks, food, merchandise, etc. we were so happy when this Starbucks opened, as its right by our church/school. The building is very pretty inside and out, and everything is working and available unlike the Starbucks on Eastern, south of this location. This alone gets three stars.  But let me now write about what gets ZERO stars. The customer service. For the first month or so, it was GREAT! Then, it was ok. Not great, but not bad either. Fast forward to last week. I got two vanilla frapachinos for my kids, one with caramel. I get this every time and have never had an issue. I pull up to the window, and I'm waiting, and waiting, and then the barista starts to make my drinks. I'm the only car in the drive-thru, so it's not busy.  As he's making them, I'm watching, and see that he makes them both without caramel. I stated caramel, and I was charged for caramel, but no biggie, it's a mistake! He eventually opens the window and starts to take my card. I say ""I'm sorry, I tried to get your attention to tell you, but one of those should have caramel."" He looks at me, slams my card on the counter, then rolls his eyes at me and sighs! REALLY??? He then slams the window shut, and angrily fixes the issue. Opens the window back up, gives me my drinks, my card, and no straws. He then realizes he didn't give me straws, hands then to me, and closes the window.  No ""thank you"", no ""sorry for the mix up"", nothing. Terrible customer service.  I tried to get his name, but we was wearing a blank name tag. So barista with the grating goatee, thanks for the less than stellar service! If I happen to be ""helped"" by you again, I'll make sure to get your name.",neutral

"I love Tivoli Village, the European-style development in the Summerlin area of Vegas, and not just because of its charming wrought iron balconies, stone facades, water fountains, and faux boulevards.  In a city that prides itself on vast casino spaces bent on sensory overload, it's almost cozy.  Tivoli Village has a quiet energy that encourages meandering among the shops and sitting on benches sipping a cocktail under trees accented with twinkling lavender-colored lights.  It's also close to home, which doesn't hurt.  All that strolling and shopping requires refueling, and Tivoli Village offers a nice variety of places to nosh. One of them is the gourmet burger joint Bottles & Burgers.  One Friday night after work, my husband and I picked up my brother-in-law and headed to B&B to get our burger on.  Kicking off the weekend, the place was hoppin' ... and filled with beautiful people.  The servers are not only selected for their customer service skills, apparently, because they all looked remarkably buff and attractive.  It wasn't just the waitstaff that was easy on the eyes; a majority of the patrons were good looking as well.  Not sure how well we fit into that mix, but no one made us feel uncomfortable.  Our booth was roomy but located right next to the restroom, a little too close for my taste.  More hustle and bustle than we wanted, but not too bad.  We started with an order of onion rings accompanied by a creamy green salsa.  The onion rings were nicely battered and crisp, and I really enjoyed the salsa.  The creaminess gave it a body that worked well with the rings, which wouldn't have been the case with a typical salsa.  It was nice step up from the standard ketchup and mustard.  I ordered a veggie burger that came with homemade potato chips.  My husband went with a nacho-style burger. My brother-in-law chose the sliders with a side order of fries and a milkshake.  The milkshake came first, along with the onion rings, and we all enjoyed a few slurps of chocolaty goodness.  It was delish!  The fries were another unqualified hit.  With both cheese sauce and gravy, they were yummy.  My bro-in-law wasn't wowed by the sliders but enjoyed them.  The homemade chips were bland enough to let the burger flavors shine... assuming they were there to shine.  My husband wasn't wild about the cheese sauce on his burger - he prefers his fromage shredded - but the tortilla chip strips stayed crunchy, and the burger was well done, just as he requested.  My veggie burger, unfortunately, was a disappointment.  It was mushy and lacked pizazz.  Even with a slice of cheese and sauteed onions and mushrooms on top, it remained blah.  I didn't finish it.  I firmly believe that a meal isn't complete without a bit of sweet, and both my husband and I indulged.  My husband's banana split reached new heights - literally and figuratively - of gourmet-ness, piled with whipped cream and topped with sugar art.  No real difference in taste from the diner version, which my husband appreciated.  He likes his classics to be classic, so he was happy.  I tried the opera cake.  It sure looked lovely with cocoa polka dots, a dainty dollop of whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The taste was just so-so.  I was bummed because I relish my desserts, and I couldn't bring myself to finish it.  Can't win 'em all, I guess.  The verdict on B&B? Fun atmosphere with interesting selections that don't always live up to their billing.  Worth a second visit.",neutral

"My gf and I decided to come here after Eastgate Mall, since it's along the way. For those planning on going to Ellen's Place, it's by the intersection of Tomken & Kamato. Even when we used the GPS, it led us to another destination. Luckily, we've been there before, but with our families being the ones that drove, we had a sense of remembering our surroundings. We went on Matheson instead and eventually found our destination. Don't be fooled: It's tucked in a ""business""-like plaza. I'm stating this, so whoever's reading this, doesn't get lost like we did.  With being Filipino-Canadian, I'm familiar with the type of food they serve here. We've been here only a couple times with our families. My aunt knows the owners of this restaurant, for she went to school with Ellen. So, needless to say, we got great service and great food every time. But this is the first time we've been here without our families and sadly, it's the exact opposite. We solely came here for the pork sisig. Quite honestly, I've only tried sisig from here and LaMesa (But theirs isn't traditional sisig, it's their own version of sisig with a twist). So I can't compare it with any other place, but regardless, their sisig is top notch. Comes to you on a sizzling pan, which you can hear from a mile away. Keep in mind that despite the sisig being on the appetizer menu, it's pretty big. We only got that and an order of garlic fried rice. We took it home, because we couldn't finish it.  We went there at 5pm on a Saturday. Which is quite possibly their busiest night of the week. Because they have a band performing and have karaoke as well. If I'm not mistaken, they have karaoke every night at 9pm. We were the first ones to get there. Waitress gave drinks and took our order right away. Shortly after she took our order, more people started filling up tables. There were a couple 4 top tables and 2 big groups of people that came in within an hour timeframe. As people have stated, Filipino food takes awhile to make, so patience is key. Which my gf and I have a lot of. But they tested it that night. We got our food, ate and enjoyed it. We both work in Food Service and know how busy it can be. But how their service is managed is poor. From 5pm-7pm there was only ONE waitress serving all the aforementioned tables. I was watching her and she was cool & calm. But she had no help from the owners, whatsoever. I only saw the two owners when they went to talk to the guests. Only once has one of the owner's lifted a dish to serve to a table. Ridiculous. We don't know what was happening in the kitchen. Maybe they were short staff. Who knows. We started to get impatient, because we were waiting an hour just for someone to clear our plates and give us dessert (We ordered the Halo Halo). At 7pm, two more waitresses showed up and started serving the big groups first, rather than the tables of 4 that came in before them. The waitresses cleared all of the dishes from the big groups, before clearing everyone else's. Maybe they do this, because they're in a big group and expect a big tip. At this point, we've decided to cancel the Halo Halo order and go to Bubble Republic for bubble tea instead. Because we didn't want to wait any longer. But shortly thereafter, she comes along with the Halo Halo and apologizes for the wait. We quickly ask for takeout containers for our food and the bill. Luckily, we had cash on us, so we didn't have to wait for anyone. But what baffles me, is I'm looking through the bill and they charge for gratuity! For 2 people! It's ridiculous, especially when the service was lacking attention. With my restaurant-going experience, I only know restaurants charge for gratuity when it's a large party. There were only 2 of us. We dropped the cash and walked out. The food was great, but the service needs working on. Our waitress did her best and was apologetic, but they need more help and a tad bit of common sense with who to serve first.  I'll definitely be coming back, but going to call ahead and order takeout. No way am I making the same mistake.",neutral

"I'm slightly surprised to see the low ratings for this place. I would actually give it a 3.5 stars. This is a place I used to dine frequently. Mainly because they were conveniently located at Santa Fe Station which is down the street to me.  I agree their service can be pretty bad sometimes, especially more recently. Maybe it might be because they will be closing soon as the Grand Cafe will be reopening in it's place...  The food and the service used to be better but it really has gone downhill. Though I still enjoy their bakery. And their seasonal menu is still interesting. I must say I do enjoy their sweet potato fries.  Their croissant sandwich is also yummy.   Try to stay away from chicken or broccoli here, I have had pieces that were bitter. eww. But you can't go wrong with their desserts, they are yummy! From the cookies to seasonal pies, etc. I went there around 4pm to have breakfast one day (it is served 24 hours but you have to ask for the breakfast menu. But the servers have no clue have to serve breakfast and what it comes with). I was so excited to find they had red velvet pancakes! But it was such a fail. The flavor and texcture of the pancakes were not good. And because it wasn't a breakfast server, she didn't know about a whipped cream cheese that should've came with it. Overall just not good...  When Coco's is gone, I might miss it. Mainly for their bakery.  This review is long overdue and I can't even remember the details. Overall, though, I do like this place for a quick bite and some sweets when I happen to be at Santa Fe Station, but would not go out of my way to dine here.",neutral

"Good bar. Decent food. Its tex mex in Pittsburgh, what do you really expect?   Mad Mex is a strange restaurant. The whole thing just feels kind of medium. The food is medium. The service is medium. The prices are pretty medium.   The food itself is always fine, but never out-of-this-world good. Everything from their fajitas to the burritos to the salads taste good, but never much beyond.   For example, on my most recent trip we ordered the 3-dip appetizer. The chips were fine, but not great. The guacamole was good, but not out of the ordinary. The cheese dip and the salsa were less interesting, but fine.   After years of hearing about the fabled ""Gobblerito"" I finally ordered one and I was disappointed. Perhaps the hype was almost impossible to live up to, but I found it to be ""good"". (For those unfamiliar, its turkey, gravy, mashed potatoes, corn, black beans  and stuffing in a burrito).   The one thing that lifts Mad Mex is its bar. I love their selection and have a particular affinity for their margaritas (frozen or standard). Delicious stuff!",neutral

"So to start out with, I'm like, incredibly lazy. I mean it's ridiculous. So the idea of a movie theater where I could sit there and press a button and have all my food and drink served to me was such an awesome concept I knew it would go really well with Jurassic Park 3D. PS: Those dinosaurs still look so awesome.   We get there and the front desk girl was really nice and when we got upstairs they gave us a menu and we went to our chairs. I noticed a couple of things here: The cup holder is awkwardly placed. I want it next to my face so I don't have to reach over in the darkness to put my cup away and hope to god I don't drop it. The tables weren't so great if you had to use the bathroom during the movie. Which I totally did so I experienced that level of awkwardness myself.   The food is okay, my friends salad was a weird combination of salads and my coconut chicken tenders were pretty solid. The service was so weird though. Like, I wasn't sure if all the people were brand new or what. They came to take our order a couple of times before they realized someone else had taken it. My coke refill took for freaking ever. Seriously. We got our check halfway through the movie so that was a genius moment on our part since everyone else had to hang out during the credits to pay.   So by all means go and enjoy, but enjoy it a little less than if you had just gone to a restaurant and a cheaper movie theater. You could probably even just sneak in some vodka and it would still be cheaper.  Oh and they validate parking but if theres a dude standing there asking you to fork over 10 dollars to park then they don't validate. I told him I would just parallel park and I parked for like 4 hours for free so if theres a lesson anywhere it's to parallel park people. The spaces here are ridiculous huge. It's not even that hard.",neutral

"Emeril is the reason I fell in love with food network. After a difficult surgery, bedridden for a month, Emeril carried me through with his shows. I miss seeing him on tv... He used to be the Flay of cooking shows. Anyway... It was a dream come true to finally eat at one of his restaurants.   The crab cake was perfect. The grits sublime. Γ‰touffΓ©e was fair, and the $80 lobster tail was disappointing (chewy).   The decor is boring in the main dining room and walls with their copper twists and cable strung art boxes were terribly dusty. The bar and entrance is charming.   As far as the service, we went in the afternoon and were quite neglected. With 13 people in the room (most of them prepping table settings for the dinner service and some walking back and forth... And three behind us at the water/wait station... ) I was surprised at how long we sat with empty drinks and no one noticing. Regardless of the dust and poor service, the food was great except for the over cooked lobster.   I look forward to visiting New Orleans and trying some more Emeril! Even with $80 chewy lobster, I still adore him and hope one day I get the chance to tell him face to face how he and his shows made a terrible time in my life so much better.  I posted 5 pictures but for some reason only 3 are showing up. I will try to edit this review to include the other pictures.",neutral

"Located inside the Monte Carlo. Price was average for Vegas. Food was average and not nearly as many items offered, as other buffets. Not much service, as it took forever for someone to get us silverware. Even beverages are self service. The dining room area looked nice, with pillars and such, but once you sat in one of the booths, you sunk down deep. So request a table. While dining, suddenly smoke started pouring out of one of the kitchen/buffet serving areas. All the employees wondered what was happening, but no one went to check it out, to make sure everyone else was safe. We were finished by this time and headed out before smoke filled the dining rooms. Vegas has changed considerably over the years and the huge inexpensive buffets are nearly all gone. Your best bet here, is at breakfast.",neutral

"My wife and I stopped in because we wanted something new. The staff was very friendly and greeted us right away as we walked in. Neither my wife or I are coffee people so we can't say anything about the coffee. What we can say is the baked chocolate croissant was DELICIOUS, buttery and flakey. Not being a coffee drinker, I went for the fruit smoothie. It could have used a little more smooth and a little less ie (ice), but it was still flavorful and tasty!!  But now for the not so delicious, we both went for the breakfast croissant sandwich. While there was nothing 'wrong' with the sandwich, it was more along the lines of a mass produced breakfast sandwich (burger king croissandwich) that had been heated up by chef Mike ( the Microwave oven, that I'm guessing gets used a lot??) and then pressed on a panini grill.  All in all, I would say if I'm in the are and the mood strikes me, I would stop in again, but I don't know if I would make this a destination stop.",neutral
"Like several other reviewers, I went to Khotan because a friend had a Groupon and we of course waited until the last minute to use it.  I checked out the menu before going and was really scared.  It really looked like a Panda Express menu with such exotic choices as sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli.  Authentic, Khotan is not. But, hey, it's food and we had a coupon.  The decor inside is really wonderful, with really interesting jade statues, ivory carvings, and a wall of gold, vault-like boxes. A++ for effort there.  We were seated outside and it was  a nice night.  But, seriously, that Sirens show is craptastic and if you're not a fan, sit inside.  We ordered Khotan lobster, chicken lo mein, brown rice, and a tempura platter.  The sauce in the Khotan lobster is great, but, gasp, it's $36. The chicken lo mein was ""eh,"" very boring and the chicken was slightly overcooked. The tempura platter was delicious but anything fried always is.  I'm conflicted because I generally liked the execution, food, and service, but it was such a boring menu I'd probably never go back.  If you want expensive Panda Express-esque food with a strip view, however, this is your place.",neutral

"Aligned with what other yelpers have said the service was below par... The waitress sent out crappy vibes to us the entire night. Our meal started off with her spilling water on one of our friends. Mistakes happen, but what really pist me off was she didn't say sorry right away. Her face had no remorse about the situation and she went to get towels to clean up. Bah. Then later she forgot to get our tables napkins and when she gave us waters she clanked the glass on the table real loud with attitude. Talk about a Debbie Downer. I do not know what this chick's problem was but if I'm going to pay $20 for a burger I expect more. I will say that the manager handled the situation well after my friend spoke to him. He took off his burger and milkshake off our tab.   Wowee! The black pepper was so bomb and the meat was perfectly cooked. I love how the pepper gave the burger a kick to it. I also love that the bun was toasted and not soggy. The bun was also really fluffy in consistency. The shoestring fries were perfect. I stole some sips of milkshakes from my friends and the ""Birthday cake"" was amazing. I would recommend sharing these milkshakes with a friend or you may get diabetes on the spot.   I give this place a 4, but -1 * for the waitress with the bad 'tude.",neutral

The Sushi was just ok and the Maguro sushi in their house sauce was good but not worth $25 for the thin slivers and not enough sauce.

Nice that there was a 10% yelp check-in offer.  I'm normally not a Buffet eater as I my mom would attest to (saying I don't eat enough to make it worthwhile lol) because I generally like my food freshly prepared & piping hot or cold.   The fruit & salad areas were fresh. Some of the hot foods: like broccoli/beef, walnut shrimp, sausage & ribs at hot bar was good.  Udon or Soba noodle soup was made fresh & cooks was kind enough to bring it over to us because we already checked on it once but then forgot when eating. Sushi was so-so. Lots of varieties but mostly average tasting (wasn't bad but wasn't the best I've tasted) food.  Ambience was clean & nice because they integrated the old Claim Jumper decor with Asian influences. I like it when someone UPCYCLES.   Would I go again? Yes for lunch (since it's more reasonable-cheaper) if I'm in area but not for dinner as first choice because for the price though I can eat at W.

"To sum it up: Nobu clone. Sake selection was impressive, but overpriced in a major way. Atmosphere is outstanding, and the room is quieter than Nobu (which can get extremely loud).   Shibuya markets itself as something of a sake destination. They have sake sommeliers who did an adequate job of suggesting bottles for us. As a sake fiend though, I found their selections a bit pedestrian and too safe. Big list though, so a good place to go for sake sampling if you are new to sake.   I won't go back, but only because I think my standards are higher for this price. Shibuya is obviously high-caliber style dining, but it just didn't strike me right for the price and what I got. I think the clumsy sake selection and insultingly overpriced sake list tainted my overall impression. Might go back to have a Sapporo and focus on the food if it's convenient.",neutral

"I like to go to the Hotel spas just to get a day pass for the facilities and relax especially when i stay there.  Spas usually give the ""luxury relaxation"" vibe- this Spa was a bit different.  The Spa here was a tad outdated, it was in need of some modern TLC. The facilities were kept fairly clean but it lacked the amenities of other spas.   When i entered, i was given a metal bucket filled with ice a chilled towel and some oranges in a plastic bag (?!) Come to find out a lot of these standard things that are in spas aren't put out here....in addition there was no bottled water and you had to have the attendant pour water into a plastic cup for you every time, there were no individually wrapped combs or brushes, just the used ones in the creepy blue solution with hairs still stuck in it.   The Shower heads here were the saving grace, they were awesome, but the peeling paint in the shower's ceiling and the loose and grimy bath gel pumps within the shower took away from it.   Between the 2 hot tubs was a loud TV blaring sports....if they dimmed the lights and pumped in tranquil spa music instead it'd have a totally new feel.  I'm glad i only paid a $10 entry fee, but with a little more attention to detail and simple things done to change the ambiance it'd be better.

Also, i was very disturbed that for the audience disappearing trick, i found out after talking to the lady on our table who had been chosen to go on stage, that after the show they had been threatened and told they would be legally liable if they said how they appeared at the rear of the theate!!

"This is your classic dive-asian-restaurant-take-out-buffet-joint-and-ma-pa-convenience-store.   This places specializes in quick take out food, with a steam table of rice and other Vietnamese deli foods to make assorted Com dishes. There are also a few shelves of desserts and deli/convenience foods.    But it has about 6 tables to sit and eat, and you can watch the TV with a DVD playing over and over again the traditional Vietnamese outfit contest portion of the Miss Universe Pageant in Nha Trang, Vietnam,  They have a decent smattering of Vietnamese fair in a grungy envirnment devoid of any charm, but the food is pretty good. Khai Vi, Pho Bo (about 17 combos) Hu Tieu, Mi Xao, Com Dia, Che, and special dishes like Bun Bo Hue, Bun Rieu,  Banh Cuon, Goi Du Du, Nem Nuong Cuon, etc.   They also have Boba drinks, coffees, etc.  Don't expect great service.   The Pho Tai Bo Vien and Pho Tai came in quite large bowls, with full size rounds of rare beef and decent size meat balls. There was also a lot of noodles, more than most places. Only $4.99, good price even for San Jose or Little Saigon.   If you want quick to go Viet food, or a cheap and large bowl of Pho in Las Vegas, try here. It is in a 2 story strip mall just below Korean Garden BBQ.  Open 7 days a week, 9 AM til 9 PM.",neutral

This place is fun to hang out and play games but PLEASE don't come expecting great food. My fries were burnt. Chicken wings over cooked. Burger over cooked. It's like the chef was tasked to overcook everything. The ironic part is the menu isn't cheap (well bar food cheap neways). They charge real restaurant (for Charlotte) prices. Bar food isn't hard to execute. They should be ashamed at the product they are putting out.,neutral

"I tried this place and got caught up in the hype of the whole fusion thing. After the novelty wears off I realized how good Mexican food and Korean food is just by themselves.  Bring these together is just a good idea on paper. Let's put it this way the place is busy busy but no Mexican and no Korean customers. If you think kimchi is the only thing Korean food has to offer go to a bone fide eatery. It doesn't take a genius to replace ground beef in Mexican dishes with bulgogi and voila...fusion. Shortly they do both cuisines rather mediocre so the combination falls short of any greatness. The only saving grace is they give you a lot of food. If you're smart you'll catch on quick to the ""just add kimchi"" trick to every dish the owners had in mind. They have Mexican food in the back part of the menu as if an afterthought.  Go yelp Thai or Pho restaurants in the area If you have a craving for Asian food.  Want good authentic Mexican cuisine look elsewhere. If you just want to be curious and say you've been here then its your time and money to lose. Synergy has not been achieved. Experiment failed!",neutral
"I went to the Stone Rose for their annual 'Nightmare on Princess Drive"" halloween party. The drinks are on the pricey side but it's a nice place with a large outdoor patio with a ton of seating and fire pits and a nice indoor with large windows so it feels a little like you're outdoors. The DJ really sucked while I was there because it wasn't real dance music and he played all the awful overplayed songs that make people change the radio station (a whole lot of black eyed peas and pitbull). The last hour he shifted into rap/hip hop which was much better but kind of late into the night. The bar was understaffed for the party and it took forever to get a drink...however I think under normal circumstances the Stone Rose would be a really nice place to come for nice cocktails & relaxing outside.",neutral

"Went for breakfast, was told to seat myself, not a problem at all had a nice seat at a well placed table since it was earlier in the morning and hardly anyone was there. I wasn't greeted by my server for 6-8 minutes, where she immediately gave me coffee (decaf), a great start to the morning, however it the coffee was hardly hot, and tasted like it had been mixed with a lot of water. Of course I know decaf is a little different than regular, but this was hardly resembling the taste of coffee. After another 8-12 minutes, my server came over again to see if I wanted to order and I got the Market hash, and asked for water, as she had not offered it to me or brought it over for the last nearly 20 minutes. She got it right over and within the next 10 minutes my food was out. It was absolutely delicious and i loved it! great seasonings, flavor and combination of veggies and eggs, wonderful temperature I almost didn't even need salt or pepper. The cheeses worked great with the dish. Somewhere in the middle of my eating my server came over (as some one else had dropped off my food) and dropped the check. If you're looking for good food go here, good service, I'm sure there are better options.",neutral
Went here last night because it was close. Pulled pork was good but the bread had a lot to be desired. I expected a bun but got what looked like uncooked French bread.

"We ended up at Sammy's Famous Corned Beef after trying to get pho at Tram's Kitchen and forgetting it was a Monday (Tram's is closed on Mondays).  The bright neon lights flashing FAMOUS across the street beckoned for us to head over and try it out... so we did.  I ordered the Sammy's Special, which is 5 ounces of corned beef topped with sauerkraut or cole slaw, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing on your choice of rye.  I went with sauerkraut and rye bread.  I also got a side of potato salad b/c it costs a buck and I was kinda worried I'd still be a little hungry after the sandwich.  The sandwich was alright; the corned beef wasn't as salty as I expected and sliced really thin.  I would've liked my bread toasted, the heat of the meat and sauerkraut warmed up the bread from the inside.  Toasted bread might have also held up to the wetness of the sauerkraut and Russian dressing; the bread was extremely soggy by my last bite.  One of my companions said their pastrami was underwhelming and to stick with corned beef (he had two sandwiches).  The potato salad was pretty standard with a dijon mustard base.    They also have a bar in the dining section of the place, but since it was around 2:30 PM in the afternoon I decided not to get a beer at that time.  Overall I was satisfied with my meal and I'd probably drop by again if I was in the area, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get their sandwich.",neutral

That being said, the sweet potato pouting is definitely worth trying, I do recommend that dish.

I ordered my food online and drove to the restaurant and parked in one of the designated to-go spots.  In a few seconds an Olive Garden employee came out to the car with just paper in her hand.

I handed her the card that clearly expires in 2018.  She took it back in and swiped and and brought back the food.   The food was amazing, as always.  My only complaint is that the chicken gnocchi soup WAS MISSING THE GNOCCHI.  How are you going to serve me soup missing one of the key ingredients??? I don't know how this happened.  The soup was delicious but I would have loved to have had at least one gnocchi.  :(",neutral

"After checking into our room, we were ready for a cocktail and decided to check this place out.  It was pretty early so most of the seating was open.  The hostess let us pick our seats so we headed over to the sofa in front of the beautiful fireplace.  The decor is very upscale and at the same time, library esque with lots of dark wood and a huge selection of books on the shelves. Our server came by and gave us a few minutes to look at the menu.  I decided on Let's Elope, a gin based drink with fresh melon and lime.  My husband ordered the Penicillin, a scotch based drink with ginger, lemon, honey.  My drink was refreshing and tasty, but I liked the Penicillin more probably because I love fresh ginger.  My husband wasn't sold on it.  We were having a nice time until two other patrons came in and sat in an area next to us and smoked nonstop.  Yes, I know it's Vegas, get used to it, but all that second hand smoke was a making a direct beeline to me.  Not only does it irritate me to breathe it in, but I hate when it permeates my hair and I end up smelling like the one with a nasty habit.  So we decided to move to some seats across the way near the bookshelves.  This was a good move, because now we had access to the books, and they were genuinely interesting books.  We started to look through some of them, and then those two smokers moved to the area we just left in front of the fireplace.  And of course, their second hand smoke once again headed straight for me.  Ugh!  I swear I must be a magnet for that crap.  So we had to leave.  If it were not for the two annoying smokers, we might have ordered more drinks.  And that's really the only reason for 3 stars.",neutral

The service was just OK, had to constantly ask for different things and was not approached by the bartendar at all to check on us, our food was spilled by the server twice upon delivery, mistakes happen I get it.

The decor was very modern, and the restaurant was pretty empty for a 730pm dinner reservation on a busy weekend, but I enjoyed our relaxing dinner despite the hectic strip.  The menu was pretty confusing - sushi, fusion food, pizzas, seafood, American. Everything seemed to be somewhat Asian inspired, except the pizzas.  We got a little bit of everything: calamari, Margarita pizza, crispy creamy shrimp, cucumber sushi, cotton candy and creme brulee and a bunch more dishes (I didn't eat all of them, so I can't recall all of them). My favorite was the crispy creamy shrimp, which is funny since I don't eat a ton of seafood. It was a great app to share with friends. The food came out in a timely manner, and the staff was friendly. It was pretty pricey, and the food was good but nothing too exciting that I would definitely want to come back here again.  I would say this is a good place for a nice dinner in Vegas, especially if you are staying at The Palms or one of its other hotels, but there is a lot more exciting places you can eat in Vegas.",neutral

I thought the biscuit was quite salty so I only ate one and my friends ate the rest. The food must've been very salty because we all drank at least 2 glasses of water during our stay at Red Lobster. We ordered the tilapia, the 30 shrimp special, and fire grilled lobster, shrimp and scallops. They were all great!

I was kind of hoping the regular price was worth it, but I was disappointed. By no means did they taste bad, but they weren't great either. I was kind of irked by the sogginess. It was all mushy and the juices from the meat mixing with the sauce made eating the ""taco"" like eating a moist sponge. I got a bulgogi beef and bulgogi chicken taco, and I noticed this was the same issue for both tacos. The beef was okay, but didn't have much flavor besides being spicy. The chicken was a bit dry, but despite that, it tasted pretty good with a mix of sweet and spicy.

I had the combo sampler platter with pork, ribs and chicken tenders,  I admit tenders are an odd item for a BBQ place perhaps.  But these are the biggest tenders I have seen.  A choice of sauces or grilled if you prefer.  Very good.  The pork was juicy and tender, the ribs fork tender and full of flavor.  But the ribs seemed to be more steamed or something like that rather than cooked low and slow on a smoker.  Sides were good too.  VERY cheesey M&C.  Yum.  The platter was pretty big too.  Maybe too big for lunch. I'm stuffed.  In and out in 30 minutes with friendly service.    Sure you could find better BBQ joints but this one won't be a bad one any time.",neutral

"We enjoyed our visit to this restaurant however the waitress makes or breaks the evening.  More on that later.  We started at the bar and the bar tender was super cool.  He made a fantastic Sazerac, one of the oldest cocktails in the USA.  The four of us admired the decor of the establishment in addition to the fun columns throughout that separated the patrons making it a more private experience.  This place is in a basement  and the columns separate everyone, different than all the open air structures these days.  We had reservations and were seated about 10 minutes late however we were flexible.  The waitress was not very friendly and did not smile.  She was making the motions.  Likely tired because it was Badger Homecoming Saturday and they were busy.  We were celebrating a birthday and asked if they did anything special.  She said I don't know and can check.  When she came back she said if you buy a desert, we can put a candle in it.  What??  What restaurant does not do something for a birthday.  Oh well, move on...  Each of us DID enjoy our meal.  We had the Crawfish Cheesecake for appetizer.  It was like a cheesecake?  Different and good.  Two of us ordered separate specials and the other two ordered items off the menu.  None of us could finish and we enjoyed leftovers the next day.  The food was rich and heavy, comfort food like.  If you are on a diet you'd need to be selective because no calories are spared here.

"Mexitaco is a small, authentic Mexican restaurant with an extensive menu of interesting dishes, most of which I'd never heard of before. The space doesn't have a whole lot of character (brightly lit, a few Mexican souvenirs on the wall, and a TV playing Mexican music videos), but there is a nice patio in the warm weather.  Browsing the menu things looked promising; all sorts of dishes I'd never heard of: flautas, sopes, enfrijoladas, and so on. Definitely a lot more selection than the usual burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. The tasty chips and salsa we were brought reinforced the positive feeling.  We ordered a few vegetarian dishes (big mistake) and everything went down hill from there. The food looked excellent and all the various sauces were great. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have already mentioned, the vegetables were a total disaster. They literally filled our food with frozen peas, corn, and carrots. The rice and beans weren't great either. A total dissappointment.  I want to like this place so I've returned a few times to see if they've improved. No luck.  So, why 3 stars? First, I had a couple meat eating friends with me and they were very positive about their dishes. So, if you order the meat and avoid the frozen veg you should be good. Second, this place has huge potential. If they would just use some fresh vegetables (red peppers please) and get some better refriend beans (it tasted like Old El Paso for christ sakes) they could be a four or five star place.  Pro Tip: Don't order anything vegetarian. Get the bunuelo for dessert: deep fried tortilla with cajeta, whipped cream, and chocolate syrup. Amazing!",neutral

"We needed a dog friendly hotel for the weekend that wasn't too far off the strip and we decided on staying here.  There was a one-time fee of 100 for the dog (no matter how long your stay was) which was reasonable. They gave you a little magnet to stick onto your door knob to let people know that there was a pet inside.  We had a one bedroom ""suite"" complete with living room and kitchenette.  The kitchenette had all the plates, pots, pans, utensils and paper towels which really worked out for us.  They had a really good complimentary hot breakfast in the morning and we would just take our food from the buffet and bring it up back to our room. We weren't too far from the strip and there were two restaurants right next to the property.  I would recommend this hotel if you needed a pet friendly place to stay in Las Vegas.",neutral

"The service is very slow do to having only one waiter wait on 6 or so tables. The sushi is very good tho so I guess it's worth the wait. We waited about an hour for a table and when we finally got a table we waited another 15 minutes just to order our drinks and food since we looked at the menu outside. Appetizers came around 25 minutes in and the sushi started coming around an hour later. In all the food was great we had grab ragoons and all sorts of sushi from the charlotte roll, philly roll, spicy salmon, wasabi roll and so on we also had the family chicken with veggies and brown rice which was the last thing served to us and 5 minutes later we got the check which was not very pleasing. They took a very long time getting our receipts back which was about 10 minutes. It was a good place for food but if you're in a hurry I don't recommend it.",neutral

Broccoli florets were also one of my favorites. The prime rib was too charred and dried. Roast beef was better. The Vietnamese ox tail broth noodle was good ( wish it was hotter in temperature). The rest of the food were just typical buffet food.  It could be the weekday menu, there was no sliders and sweet potato fries. The last time we were here, there was more options.",neutral

"DQ... yes, it's a chain. DQ... yes, it's pretty much a household name and has been for years. DQ... yes, it brings back warm and fuzzy childhood memories for many. DQ... has filled many a sweet craving during my two pregnancies. DQ... from multi-ingredient blizzards to simple vanilla ice-cream cones, you really can't find a bad item on their (dessert) menu. DQ... it's an oldie but goodie!  On a recent visit with girlfriends, I did see that DQ now offers all kinds of food items as well.  Maybe they've done this for years, but I haven't really ever paid attention as I've gone in for my ice cream cone, blizzard, or slushie, and left.  On this particular visit, I stood in a longer line and actually looked at the menu.  I'm not so sure I'd trust this location or any other DQ for chicken fingers, hot dog, hamburger, salad, etc...   That being said, go here for dessert.  The service is fine, but not super friendly.  There is a decent amount of seating available, which is more than can be said for their Old Town Scottsdale location, and most importantly, the ice cream will not disappoint.

"Taste: I ordered off of their lunch menu which is available from 11:30 to 5:00. The lunch combo comes with a Tom Yum Thai Hot & Spicy Soup which was flavourless and was not Tom Yummy at all. It also comes with a Vegetarian Spring Roll which was nothing special. For the dish, I had the Mussamun Curry Beef Brisket. This I thought was great because the beef brisket was nice and tender, and I really enjoyed the peanut flavour of the curry.   Service: The service was good. Nothing bad happened, and nothing exceptionally good happened.  Value: I think that the prices are really good here, even though part of my lunch wasn't so great. The whole combo was $9.95 which is super affordable for a decent Thai lunch.  Ambiance: Nice Thai themed decor and a lot of table room.",neutral

"This is one is a very good place among the so many places the China Town has to offer. They offer both sushi selections and hot pots. Which is a pot with your choice of broth, meats and vegetables.   The one we chose was the hot pot with the spicy miso broth, just the broth itself was good. We also chose the seafood selection which came with mussels, shrimp, scallops, salmon, and veggies. I had read on Yelp how good the Kobe beef was, so we added an order into the pot, which i'm glad we did. There are two options in size, the healthy portion and i believe the other was called the hungry portion. We tried the healthy portion which was more than enough to share between two people.   When i checked in with Yelp i got a free hot sake, so worth it.",neutral
The food was excellent and our waiter was not only attentive but friendly and accommodated my fish allergies (I can eat shellfish just not actual fish). Our glasses were never empty and any trash on the table disappeared just as soon as it was created. Our dinner was served in a timely manner and our drinks well made. Everything was exactly the way I remember it from my youth my disappointment was how far it's fallen in manner of class. McCormick and Shmick used to have a dress code and an expectation of elegance. We dressed to go out and found ourselves surrounded by people speaking loudly on their cellphones and in t-shirts. Not only has the standard for their dress code died but so has their desire to create a comfortable atmosphere I felt like I was in a noisy McDonald's with crying children and cellphone conversations as well as cellphone arguments going on all around me.

"While not my first place to go for middle eastern fare, it is a place to keep in the rotation.  Tempe has no shortage of Middle Eastern food and this is one of the good ones.  The staff is very friendly, the food comes out quick and is quite tasty.  Better yet, it is less than 1/4 mile from my house.    I know many people recommend the lentil soup, which I tried based on the recommendations and I thoroughly enjoy.  They use red lentils rather than the green (?) lentils that seem more common.  In my experience, red ones are more mild and more delicate.  I don't recall what entrees we got but it was tasty.  The only issue I had with this place once is that they randomly close early.  It could have been a single occurrence but I called to see if they were open after 8p, and he said no.  Then when I went in a few weeks later their hours say they close at 9p.  I have no problem with people closing when they aren't busy, but I would suggest making a phone call to check if they are open if you plan on going later in the evening.",neutral

"We came here for Winterlicious $48 three-course dinner as the restaurant is a new addition this year. The atmosphere is really nice and the staff are all dressed up in matching outfits.   An important point to note. Upon looking at photos of other customers who went to Winterlicious earlier, the plating was what caught my eye. They used plates with elegant blue floral designs. I was disappointed as I only received a plain white plate for my dessert. The man beside my table received the blue plate that I kept seeing in the photos, he ordered before I did.  We ordered the following:    App: - Dorade Ceviche (milk aioli, lime, sepia dressing, escarole, shoestring potatoes) This was the best dish. The fish was fresh and nicely paired iwth the sauce. It was also topped with shoestring potatoes (which reminded me of Hickory sticks).   Mains: - Chitarrine a la amatriciana (clams, egg noodles, guanciale, tomato sauce, reggianito, chili)  This was disappointing. It seemed like something you would get at a restaurant that prices it for cheaper. The sauce was a bit spicy but the sauce was a bit too salty. - Eggplant Milanesa (northern woods mushroom and chickpea stew, green olives, red wine sauce) This was interesting. The eggplant was fried and was plated on top of the chickpea stew. The flavours were flavourful, but nothing spectacular.   Dessert: - Candied Orange & Almond Cake (marmalade syrup, sour cream ice cream) The cake was very dry and dense. The marmalade syrup helped to lighten it, but it was still not the best. The sour cream ice cream was unique however, and I enjoyed it.   Verdict: I will not go back again. The food is not anything too amazing. For the price of what I'm paying, there are many other places you can go to.",neutral

"I have to teeter between three and four stars on this one and tell you the short story is that the atmosphere is among the BEST so food almost doesn't matter. The decor is modern, beautiful and whimsical. The Food I tried was somewhat Basic and really was OK but was unlike the decor. (maybe I just wanted it to be a little fancier to wow me)  I thought the Kitchen not the servers seemed a bit out of sync to me on our visit here so  that helped influenced me to go with three stars.   This is a special destination place and is good for groups but  if you desire a private room for your group they must spend at least two thousand dollars. You also need to be aware That a three course dinner with a group of people takes about three hours.  I will say I don't agree with most of the reviewers saying the pricing is too high for what they got. I don't recall all the pricing but from what I remember  $24. for Jidori Chicken, $39. for Kolbe style hanger steak, $30 for Sea bass and $8 for ample sides are really what most places would charge.  I will say I didn't care about the parking because it was 118 degrees, I was all dressed up and didn't feel like walking threw the hot parking lot and we felt like valeting it but the valet was closed to people not staying over night in the casino.   While waiting for the group I was joining I decided to try a Negroni ($15.) Cocktail. It was made with all name brand stuff and was a double size. So I think it was a very fair price for a special old school cocktail that is one of Anthony Bourdain's last meal list. It's a very unique taste of bitter, sweet  but not too sweet and boldly strong in a good way and seemed kind of refreshing. They had live entertainment in the lounge and some people were dancing.   It was very dark in the restaurant and so you had to use your phone as a light to read the menu. Our group takes a very long time to decide so I do an Anthony Bourdain and decide to have another cocktail. I don't know how long it took but we arrived at 7 and I looked at my phone and saw it was 8:38 and we still didn't have appetizers yet. I was thinking that they'd come out with dinner but they didn't (Phew) and did arrive after some amount of time.   When my halibut arrived I found out it was dry and over cooked but the majority of meals that were served to our table were fine. The waiter asks me how it was and I was honest and said the halibut was very dry and over cooked but still edible and I didn't feel like sending it back. The waiter talked me out of feeling that way and said he'd have a new one for me shortly....and he DID! The new one was cooked just right so it was good. Nothing wrong with it just good sitting on some dried chili pineapple sauce. I did find out latter that the other person at my table with halibut also had dry halibut but didn't tell the waiter.   Over all I was happy and now know I also like Negroni Cocktails. Those cocktails are almost even healthy as the bitters in the drink are good for your liver and help contradict the gin.  The halibut was good but wasn't up there with a few others I had this year so that's why it's three star to me. I know everyone was happy and we would go back again.",neutral

"Really, this is closer to a 3.5  I've heard lots and lots about Blowfish so I had to come.  Before Blowfish, the only sushi I've had is at AYCE places and here and there at a random Japanese/Fusion Restaurant, so it was definitely an experience for me.   Must add that the table we sat on is the one featured on the menu on the website. Kinda cool.    I was a tad bit drunk, but I remember everything clearly.  The service was fantastic. I must add that. The decor was over the top. I kinda felt like..white people overdoing the japanese thing.   And that basically sums up the whole experience.  While the food was really good, it just didn't live up to what I expected.  Let's talk food.  We had:  1. The Spicy Salmon maki - Basically my favourite item. It was the best spicy salmon I've ever had. The green onions really popped, and the flavours were extremely well balanced here.  2. The Rock Shrimp maki : It was devoured by my friends and I, it was delicious but too over the top. The roll comes with the deep fried shrimp on top, which I felt took away from the rest of the roll. Honestly don't even know what was in the rest.   3. The Red Curry Salmon : Again, I thought the sauce was way too overpowering. I couldn't even make out the salmon in this one.  4. Coconut Bay : I wasn't wowed by it.   5. The Wagyu Beef Gyoza was mad delicious. MAD DELICOUS.  6. The Albacore Tuna was really good. It had a delicous garlic chip that really made the roll.  7. The Chili Berries Saketini was awesome. A little too sweet for my tastes, and I was hoping it would be a touch spicier, but delicious none the less.   All in all it was a great experience. I would defo go back, but it was about 60 a person.",neutral

I get it, there was a lot of us and I can give people benefit of the doubt and I know he had other tables to attend to but I thought we were all pleasant toward him. Everyone ordered their food and received it except 3 of us. I waited patiently and then finally said something wondering where my steak plate was. They brought it out and I was shocked, it was small but surprisingly very good. Small strips of steak was placed on small rounds of purΓ©ed mashed potatoes and it was really good. Just as I had finished ANOTHER steak plate arrived that no one had ordered. Apparently the waiter asked for me to be served as soon as possible but somehow another order was put in for the same thing. I'm guessing they never even started mine and gave me someone else's order. They asked if I wanted it and I declined and then the waiter said ""looks like you liked it, couldn't hurt to have another one"". So I accepted it, assuming it would be free, with all the mistakes and me waiting much longer than anyone else. After two plates of $20 steak and potatoes I was full and satisfied. Price wise each dish should've been $10 for the amount of Food you get. I also got a cheese platter I think for $17 ish and for that price and what you get it is absolutely NOT worth it. I can't believe they overcharge so much for this. It should be $10 and even that is still too much.   Now my girlfriends actually had still never gotten one of the plates they ordered. I think it was lobster or crab or something. They asked multiple times when it was coming and they kept saying ""it was coming"". An hour and a half later this dish still had not arrived. Then finally our waiter says that they didn't have any lobster or crab left. Hm, what were they apparently making then? Finally, they asked for it to be taken off the bill. A few minutes later the same waiter we've had all night returns with the bill with my ""extra"" steak and their never arrived food on it. Oh and another girl thought hers was too spicy and needed that taken off the bill as well, which they failed to do as well. Oh did I mention a glass of wine is $16 at the lowest and a glass of Figi water WHICH WE NEVER ASKED FOR was $10 each??!!!! I'm appalled honestly at the prices. Also, since it's customary on parties over 8 (or is it 10 people?) you HAVE to tip 18%. Ridiculous and not worth it. I'm only giving it 3 stars because my steak dish was very yummy. Service was beyond slow as well. If we have to pay 18% tip they should have one waiter to only our table because he seemed way too distracted and upset with us. Oh and 15 mins before I knew we had to leave I said ""we have to leave by 9 so we need the bill. It didn't come til 25 mins later and was wrong. We didn't leave there til 9:40 because of the mistakes on our bill. Seriously, you need money, patience and a lot of time on your hands to deal with just getting food here.",neutral

Good lunch spot if you work in the area and need something that is reliably fast. They are super-efficient here -- they bring you miso soup and green tea before you've even ordered.

"This is a reasonably acceptable take-out Chinese & Sushi place. The Sushi was fine. Nothing to write home about. Sufficiently fresh fish, but was not made with proper Sushi rice.

No surprises or disappointments here. Just a regular strip-mall Chinese & Sushi restaurant.",neutral
"So the only reason I am giving 3 stars is we dined in thinking they would have adequate seating. Boy was I wrong. They had a tv on playing a hockey game which was so loud I couldn't pay attention to anything else.   Also, I order a chicken Greek salad and totally had a brain fart and forgot to ask for the dressing on the side. When I was finally able to track the owner down he was not super kind about the request saying that he had already made it and kinda huffing & puffing about how he would have to make a new one. I am way to big of a push over and agreed that it would be fine.   The salad was actually quite delicious and thankfully he didn't totally overdo it with the dressing but it was still a little too oily. The food alone is at least 4 starts and I might be back but only for take out and now I know to ask for the dressing on the side.   The owner did offer after the food came out to make me another one if I didn't like it, but it would have been nice to have been offered that option first.   They also have no restrooms and served my meal on a paper plate. In my opinion, it's a take out only place.",neutral

We made reservations, and it turned out not to be completely necessary as the place wasn't crowded.  Still, I always recommend if you can plan ahead.  Service was kind and efficient and they gladly brought out whatever we needed in a timely way.  Having said that, I found the meat to be fatty for me, and the accompaniments weren't that great.  They gave us a corn and cheese casserole for one of our sides that tasted like can corned sprinkled with cheese.  Also, the meat really stuck to our grill so bad they had to get us another.    It was fun, we had an enjoyable time, but we were hungry later.  I likely won't be back, but know that many there seemed to really enjoy.",neutral

"Wasn't impressed. Went for lunch with my boss and peer. Entering the restaurant is confusing, you need to walk past tables or the bar to the find the hostess table. There were plenty of empty tables (odd for uptown during the noon hour). After we were seated, we weren't greeted by our waitress for several minutes. After placing both our drink and lunch orders, it took another several minutes to get our drinks. The food was not quick to be served, either. I had the falafel, it came with a salad. Both were fine but not anything I'd have a burning desire to come back for.   If there wasn't a wait for a table, I had ample time to dally and I really wanted (poor) table service, I'd go back if pressed. If I just wanted a good, quick falafel, I'd go to Pita Pit. Not exactly competition but the falafel is way better over there.",neutral

"Went to the Scottsdale P.F.Chang's  The waitress suggested the Ginger Chicken with Broccoli.  I love veggies so order her suggestion.  The brown rice came in a small dish and was very dry and I hardly had enough to mix with the entree; plus there was no room on the plate to stir the meal.  The broccoli surrounded the chicken on the plate.  The broccoli was steamed and now getting cold since it was not mixed with sauce and chicken.  Mixing it with the sauce would have added flavor too.  As I ate the broccoli, I noticed the sauce was under the chicken only.  I asked the waitress why wasn't the dish all stir fried together.  The sauce would have helped keep the broccoli warm and flavorful.   She suggested next time I am in for a meal, tell them and they will stir fry that dish.  Isn't this an Asian type restaurant?  She did not offer to have the chef stir fry the remaining meal.  I had only eaten a little of the broccoli.  Humm..  Not  very smart.  I probably won't be back.",neutral

"We have had dinner at Eno Vino on Junction Road many times in the past. It's our go-to place when folks come in from out of town, birthdays, and sometimes--just because. It's not the cheapest place, but if the food is good and one is treated well, it's worth it. And we've had many evenings there with servers who took great care of us. So imagine our surprise when we went recently for my birthday, and the service was just meh. I am a person who likes birthdays--mine and others. I had noted on the reservation that we were there for a birthday. I also told our server. She didn't remark on it more than ""oh."" I wasn't expecting a free anything, but a happy birthday or even a candle in our dessert would've been nice. Nothing, nada, zip. Our server was polite, but not warm. She was helpful in suggesting dishes but didn't check on us once they came, and it was not a busy night. In fact, I had to ask for a new fork at one point, while she was standing up next to the bar talking to the Asst. Manager. In addition, we ordered the pear tart for dessert, and she bought spoons to eat it with--the tart had a crust that one could not cut through easily with a spoon. We couldn't get her attention, so we just took forks from the table next to us that was set. So maybe this was an off night--that's what I'm hoping--but we may give them a little break for a while.",neutral

"This review is for 3.5 stars.  I don't know what else you can ask for at a bar on the Strip.  Rock climbing wall, beer pong, and a full bar.  It's not gonna blow you away with the quality of the drinks, the selection, or the prices, but overall it's a nice spot if you're looking for somewhere to drink.  They have a solid Happy Hour and they have  an outside area to strip people watch if the weather is right.  It has a similar vibe to any of the other chain bars, but the ideal location on this side of the strip knocks it up a peg.  There are definitely better places to go if you're looking for a quality drink or an upscale clientele.  But if you just want a college environment similar to a Tilted Kilt or the like, then PBR is a great substitute.",neutral

"First off the service was amazing.  Our waiter, Eric, was an all around star.  Most of the food was great, just way over priced and the portions were too small for the amount.  160 for a fourth of a suckling pig and a bit of salad.  Then a 2 pound bone in rib eye, for 200.  The meat was great but i felt peter lugers is better.  The omelette was perfect.  The croquettes were not cooked all the way through, the lox and bagel cones sucked.  The augratin potatoes were good.  The salted caramel ice cream was amazing but the waffle thing sucked.  then they try to compensate with a bunch of little costco free deserts.  No free bread or table something.  the next night i went to andiamos and had better food, more of it, and for half the price.  sorry but 300 dollars extra for the celebrity chef name is not worth it if the food does not match the hype.  Spent 650 no drinks.  Good place to go if you have an expense account and can order with impunity.",neutral

I finally got to try their hand-pulled noodle instead of knife shaved version this time. I love the chewiness of their noodle. The soup was light and not oily at all.

After our most recent delicious plate of snow peas, we decided to return, and this time, the snow peas were missing that addictive flavor. They weren't as sweet, nor as seasoned with wok-iness. I ate them, but I wasn't compelled to eat them faster than my husband to ensure I had more (which I did last time!). We also ordered a noodle dish, and it seemed a tad dry although the flavor was solid. I still think the nice sized, $4 miso soup is a good value on the Strip, but it doesn't have seaweed. Still, for $4 it is a cheap way to sustain yourself!

The dessert drinks are wonderful so it's a great place to end the evening. They have awesome dessert martinis and spiked hot beverages and milkshakes as well. Because we typically end our evenings here, I haven't had much of the food, but what I have tried was acceptable and average for down town. There's a los a large dessert selection if you're in to that.   The service is average, nothing noteworthy either way.   The Chocolate Bar is defiantly worth a stop for those with a sweet tooth.",neutral

"Small little salon. I ended up here, because it was the only place I could find that was open on July 4th. I need a quick under arm wax, and they did a good job. Took me with no appointment, after I called to let them know I was on the way (actually to see if they were open)  The girl did a great job, it lasted longer than I expected. I was in and out in about 15 minutes.  I'd definitely go back.",neutral

"I haven't been to a Olive Garden in years........ First off I am not big on Italian and second I just can't seem to connect with Olive Garden. They seem to all be the same so nothing against this particular store. I mean I dislike the food, atmosphere, decore etc. It was a friend of mines birthday and she picked the spot. As to be expected I didn't really enjoy my food and surprisedly she didn't either. I will say or waiter (David) was amazing. The manager also came by our table to ask how everything was so that was pretty cool. Again nothing to do with this store I just don't vibe well with Olive Garden.",neutral

Nice atmosphere in the ever popular Downtown Chandler area. So many places to choose from down here.   We heard it was opening and decided to give it a go for Happy Hour.  My opinion thusfar on this place is they miscalculated their demographic and the income of the area. It is VERY EXPENSIVE.   Its the kind of place you go for $14 drinks. Typically for that i'd be going to N Scottsdale. This is downtown chandler. Median income is say $40k?  Drinks were weak and loaded with Ice. Decided not to try any of the happy hour food menus because none of them sounded appealing to us at the time. For example a bowl of Olives for $9.  We may try it again since we are just south of it 3 miles.,neutral
"This place has a dirt cheap daily lunch special - $4.95.  On the day we went it was CA roll and tempura.  Other days have combinations with chicken teriyaki.  Miso soup and salad are included.  The portions were huge.  Granted we were a group of lighter eaters (mostly senior citizens except me) but everyone seemed to have half of their rolls and a few pieces of tempura leftover.  There must have been 12 pieces of CA roll per order.  They tasted ok, just average.  The tempura was way overdone with a thick batter, and just looking at its oiliness made me queasy.  And ah yes, there was also a greasy tempura smell when entering the restaurant.  Good deal for the wallet but not the palate.",neutral
"The dinner service was quite good and the staff were polite and friendly. For service I would give 5 stars. The ambience was good, though before remodeling last year, my opinion is that it was better. The food was not what I was hoping for. The samosas lacked flavor and the shell was rather thick for a samosa. The tandoori paratha was very good. The main dish I ordered, malai kofta, was a big disappointment. I did order mild assuming this meant minimal hot chilis not expecting little or no spices in the malai kofta and the sauce as well. The sauce tasted too tomato like. It looked like a mixture of sour cream and canned tomato pieces with some food coloring. The pistachio kulfi was passable. It was too green in color. Because it was served in a martini glass, it was a little hard to cut a piece with a spoon when trying to eat it without tipping over the glass. Overall, the food was below average. The only reason why I might give it another try some day is that the service and ambience made it a good dining experience.",neutral

i don t like being at home it feels so unwelcome in fact i despise it,sadness
Stopped by over the weekend for some lunch and was quite surprised. The food was delicious. I had a turkey burger and my husband had one of their grilled cheese sandwiches. Both were wonderful. They had a good selection of beer on tap as well. The only downside was despite them not being super busy the service was lacking. We were never given napkins or utensils and our waitress didn't come back until we asked for our check. Disappointing but the food alone can keep at least 3 stars. May try it again in hopes the service is better.,neutral
